This causes to heat the Earth’s atmosphere, which increases the average global temperature. Climate Change describes Long-term weather pattern, and with increased average global temperatures, wind currents are altered, extra ice melts, and as a result of the ice melting, the sea level rises.

This causes a pressure to b exerted on the walls of the container, that is, a force per unit area.\nPressure is measured in Pascals, 1 Pa = 1 N/m2\nWe also measure pressure in atmospheres, where 1 atm = 101.3kPa\n\nKinetic Theory of Gases §\n\nThe kinetic theory of gases links the macroscopic behaviour of a gas with its microscopic behaviour.\n\nIn macroscopic terms, a gas is a phase of matter that has a fixed mass and whose values is equal to the volume of its container. The gas exerts pressure on the walls of the container.\nIn microscopic terms, a gas is a collection of many particles that collide with each other and the container walls.\n\n\nThe kinetic theory relates the pressure exerted by a gas to the motion of its particles.\nThe kinetic theory of gases was developed from experimental evidence to explain the similar behaviours of all gases.\nMathematical relationships between pressure, volume, moles and temperature have been derived for an ideal gas, that is, a gas that obeys all the equations perfectly.\nThere is no such thing as an ideal gas- no real gases behave exactly as the laws describe. However, under normal conditions, almost all gases follow the ideal gas model very closely.\nReal gases deviate most from ideal gas behaviour at very low temperatures and very high pressures.\nGases with small particles like hydrogen and helium follow the ideal gas laws most closely.\n\nSince they have smaller particles, and less interactions between particles.\n\n\n\nIdeal Gas Assumptions §\n\nWhen describing an ideal gas, the following assumptions are made:\n\nthe motion of all particles is random.\nall particles travel in straight lines.\nany forces of attractions (intermolecular, electrostatic, and gravitational forces) are negligible.\nall particles of the same gas are identical, and perfect spheres.\nthe internal energy of the gas is entirely kinetic.\nall collisions between particles and the walls of the container are completely elastic (there is no loss of energy).\nparticles take up negligible volume (pressure is due to mobility).\nnewton’s law of motion apply (for every opposite action, there is an equal and opposite reaction etc).\n\n\n\nKinetic Energy and Temperature §\n\nImportant aspect of kinetic energy is that:\n\ntemperature is related to average kinetic energy of the particles.\nhowever, there is a range of kinetic energy values for the particles at any particular temperature - some move faster and some move slower than average.\n\n\nmaxwell-boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of kinetic energies of particles at a given temperature.\n\ny axis is number of particles molecules in a sample.\nx axis is the kinetic energy (E)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKinetic Energy &amp; Particle Velocity\nKE = 1/2 mv^2 (we dont need to do calculations with the formula AT ALL)\nparticle with greater mass will have a lower average velocity.\n\nMeasuring Temperature §\n\nabsolute or thermodynamic scale of temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles. It is measured in degrees Kelvin (K). When the temperature is measured in Kelvin, the temperature of a substance is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of its particles.\nAbsolute temperature starts at absolute zero - the theoretical lowest possible temperature, at which points the particles would have no kinetic energy. The absolute scale has units of the same magnitude as the Celsius scale.

The main power source in our experiment is a power supply, specifically a battery.\nThe electromotive force (EMF), E, of a source is the energy supplied to each coulomb of charge which passes through the source. It is commonly measured in volts, V. (Physics, Mr Mitchell, 2023)\nConsider the circuit below which has a battery, a voltmeter, load resistor, R, and switch, S.\n\n(Fig 1: a basic circuit featuring a battery, a voltmeter, load resistor and as which made from tools at circuit-diagram.org)\nWhen the switch is open, the circuit is called an open circuit, where no current is flowing. In this scenario, the voltmeter gives the EMF. If the battery was 6V, the voltmeter in an open circuit would show 6V.\nHowever, when the switch is closed, current is able to flow through the circuit. In the real world, as all materials have some sort of resistance, the power supply must have its own resistance, called the internal resistance, r. This means we can model a power supply of electrical energy (battery) in series with a small resistance (internal resistance), as show in Fig 2.\n\n(Fig 2: Real Source)\nIn a closed circuit with a battery with an internal resistance, if we attempt to measure the volts, the measured volts will usually be lower than volts output by the battery. The voltmeter connected to the variable supply measures the potential difference, Vtpd.\nIf we link our power supply without a circuit, (the switch is turned off), there is no current to the battery, and we can get our maximum voltage. (The Physics Classroom, 2022)\n·       When current is drawn from an electrical source, some energy is wasted inside the source due to its internal resistance. This is referred to as the lost vaults, Vlost.\n\n·       This means that there is less voltage available to the load resistor, R. The voltage available at the terminals of the electrical source, and therefore across the load resistor, is called the terminal potential difference (tpd), Vtpd.\n\n·       By conservation of energy,\n\nor\n\nwhere:\n-       E is the electromotive force measured in Volts (V).\n-       V is terminal potential difference measured in Volts (V).\n-       I is current measured in Amperes (A).\n-       R is internal resistance measured in ohms (Ω).\nThe equation can be rewritten as and factorised into .\nQuestions\nQ. If a source (battery) had zero internal resistance what would happen if the battery was shorted out?\nIf a battery with zero internal resistance is shorted out (connected directly with a wire across its terminals), theoretically, an infinite amount of current would flow through the circuit. This is because the internal resistance of the battery is responsible for limiting the current that flows through it. With zero internal resistance, there would be no resistance to the flow of electrons, resulting in an extremely high current.\nQ. If we measure the voltage of the source when current flow is zero, what is the PD across this resistance and how would voltage measured compare to the emf?\nIf you measure the voltage of the source when there is zero current flowing through it (open circuit conditions), you would be measuring the electromotive force (emf) of the source. This is because the entire voltage drop would occur across the source itself, and none across any internal resistance. So, the voltage measured in this scenario would be equal to the EMF of the source.\nQ. Voltmeters have a high resistance but not infinite, is it possible to get a 100% accurate reading of emf using a voltmeter?\nWhile voltmeters have high resistance, they are not truly infinite in resistance. In practical terms, they have very high resistance compared to the components they are connected to, and this minimizes the current drawn from the circuit being measured. This is done to ensure that the voltmeter doesn’t significantly affect the circuit it’s measuring.\nHowever, due to the finite resistance of the voltmeter, it will draw a small amount of current from the circuit it’s measuring, and this can cause a slight voltage drop across the internal resistance of the source. This means that when you measure the voltage across the terminals of the source using a voltmeter, you might measure a value slightly lower than the actual emf of the source.\nPost-Lab Discussion\n1.     Use a graphical method to obtain emf and r from either slopes or intercepts of your raw or manipulated data. How do these values compare with the values you obtained by direct measurement?\nThe internal resistance, r, is the absolute value of the slope of the graph.\nGreen r is 1.7 ohms, Yellow r is 1.6 ohms, Red r is 2.9 ohms.\nThe emf can be found by the y intercepts of our data. Using the graph, we draw a line of best fit and measure the y intercepts, we find that:\nGreen emf is 5.6 volts, Yellow emf is 5.5 ohms, Red emf is 5.3 ohms.\n2.     How do the emf and internal resistance of a flat dry cell compare with those of a fresh dry cell?\nOver time the conductivity of the cell contents decreases, thus increasing the internal resistance of the cell. The instantaneous EMF drops too; but the standard cell EMF does not as the standard EMF depends on electrolyte used. (Kundu, 2017)\n3.     How does the internal resistance of an alkaline battery compare with that of a heavy-duty battery of the same size and shape?\nGenerally, alkaline batteries have lower internal resistance compared to heavy-duty batteries of the same size and shape. Alkaline batteries can deliver energy more efficiently, and heavy-duty batteries, on the other hand, tend to have higher internal resistance, making them less suitable for applications that require higher currents or consistent power output. (Machine Design, 2022)\n4.     The battery in a torch has been used for a long time. Explain why the torch is dim even though the emf of each cello is the same as when they were first bought.\nAs a battery in a torch is used over time, its internal resistance increases, causing voltage drops and reduced energy delivery. The battery stores a finite amount of chemicals, which deplete as energy is being used. When the chemicals become low in quantity, reactions will become negligible, and electricity available also becomes negligible. This is the discharging process of battery, causing the light to be dimmer. (Deshpande, 2018)\n5.     Does a power pack have internal resistance? Explain your answer.\nYes. All power supplies have some resistance between their terminals called internal resistance. This causes charges in the circuit to dissipate some electrical energy in the power supply itself. The power supply becomes warm when delivering a current. (O’Hanlon, n.d.) Materials used in power sources are not perfect conductors. Microscopic impurities, crystal defects, and other imperfections within materials can create localized areas of higher resistance.\nBibliography §\nDeshpande, R. (2018). When a battery in a torch is used for several weeks, the light from its bulb becomes dim. We say that the battery or cell is discharged. What does it mean?

HOWEVER, diagnosis of cancerous growths inside the body, a variety of radioisotopes tagged to particular drugs are used.\nThe radioisotope is known as a radioactive tracer.\nThese drugs, radiopharmaceuticals, can be administered by swallowing (ingestion), inhalation or injection.\nA gamma-ray camera can be used to perform a bone scan.\n\nThis patient has been injected with the radioisotope technetium-99m (v commonly used)\n\ngamma emitter\nhalf life of 6 hours\n\n\nThe camera detects the emitted gamma-rays and produces an image on a computer screen.\n\n\nThe radioisotope used depends on the site of the suspected tumour.\nThe body naturally distributes different elements to different organs. For example, iodine is sent to the thyroid gland by the liver. So if a radiopharmaceutical containing radioactive iodine is ingested, most of this iodine will end up in the thyroid.\nWhen the tracer has reached the target organ, a radiation scan is taken with a gamma-ray camera.\nAn unusual pattern on the scan indicates a possible cancerous tumour. The radioisotopes used for this type of diagnosis need to be gamma-ray emitters so that the radiation has enough penetrating ability to pass out of the body to reach the detector—the gamma-ray camera.\nThe isotope should have a relatively short half-life so that the patient is not subjected to any unnecessary long-term exposure to radiation.\nRadioactive tracers are also used to monitor other bodily functions. Some examples are shown in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nradioactive tracerfunction monitorediodine-123function of thyroid glandxenon-133function of lungsphosphorous-32blood flow through bodyiron-59level of iron uptake by spleentechnetium-99mblood flow in brain, lungs and heart function of liver metabolism of bones\n\n\n nuclear power stations employ a variety of safety mechanisms to prevent nuclear accidents, including shielding, moderators, cooling\n\n\nFuel rods: long, thin rods containing pellets of enriched uranium\n\n\nModerator: material that slows down neutrons\n\nGraphite, water, heavy water, carbon dioxide\nHeavy water is the best but is too expensive\nWater with dueterium, (Hydrogen-2) an isotope of hydrogen\nGraphite and carbon dioxide contain carbon which is denser than hydrogen\nEnsures that neutron capture occurs\nWhen the neutrons collide with small nuclei, they lose most of their kinetic energy\n\n\n\nControl rods: material that absorbs neutrons\n\nBoron steel or cadmium\nEnsures energy release is controlled and stable, due to them controlling the amount of neutrons for fission\n\n\n\nCoolant: liquid to absorb heat energy that has been produced by nuclear fission, goes to cooling tower to cool down\n\ne.g. water\n\n\n\nRadiation shield (shielding): thick concrete wall that prevents neutrons/radiation/radioactive waste escaping from the reactor\n\n\n the management of nuclear waste is based on the knowledge of the behaviour of radiation.\n\n\nA major problem facing the nuclear power industry is the disposal of the unstable radioactive waste.\n\n\nRadioactive waste products are classified as low-level, intermediate level or high-level waste.\n\nLow-level waste is generated primarily from hospitals, industry and laboratories and consists mostly of tools, clothing, used wrapping material and other items that have been contaminated with radionuclides with short half-lives. Low-level waste solids are usually compacted or incinerated, then buried in shallow pits on land or at sea.\nIntermediate-level waste typically consists of reactor components, chemical sludges, and contaminated materials from reactors that have been decommissioned. Intermediate-level wastes are solidified in bitumen or concrete, then buried or stored in deep trenches.\nHigh-level waste is waste from contaminated reactor parts, as well as liquid waste from the reprocessing of spent fuel rods. This waste contains highly radioactive fission fragments and transuranic elements, and so requires special shielding during handling and transport. High-level waste remains radioactive for an exceedingly long time and needs to be stored permanently.\n\n\n\nBy way of comparison, the activity of one tonne of uranium ore is only 8 × 10^11Bq\n\n\nUranium-235 and uranium-238 nuclei in these fuel rods have half-lives of 700000 and 4.5 billion years respectively. The numerous fission fragments have a wide range of half-lives. The fuel rods must be permanently stored in cooling ponds inside nuclear power stations in order to protect people from the radioactive emissions. In Japan, Russia and Europe, the spent fuel rods are reprocessed. The uranium is extracted and reused as nuclear fuel. This is an expensive process.\nScience Understanding:\n\n\n the nuclear model of the atom describes the atom as consisting of an extremely small nucleus which contains most of the atom’s mass, and is made up of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons surrounded by negatively charged electrons\n\n\nliterally the check point, no extra info abt it i dont think\n\n\n nuclear stability is the result of the strong nuclear force which operates between nucleons over a very short distance and opposes the electrostatic repulsion between protons in the nucleus\n\n\nElectrostatic forces define protons as repelling each other, but in the nucleus, an external “strong nuclear force” needs to be considered which allows protons to be very close to other protons without repelling and breaking the nucleus apart.\n\n\nThe strong nuclear force is a force of attraction that holds the nucleus together and acts between every nucleon regardless of their charge. Protons are also attracted to nearby neutrons and protons.\n\n\nThis force only acts over relatively short distances so for nucleons on the opposite sides of a large nucleus, this force is not significant. In a stable nucleus, there is a delicate balance between the repulsive electric force and the attractive strong nuclear force.\n\n\n some nuclides are unstable and spontaneously decay, emitting alpha, beta (+/-) and/or gamma radiation over time until they become stable nuclides\n\n\nalpha decay §\nno notes, assumed prior knowledge\nbeta decay §\n\nsplit into b+ and b-\n\nbeta - §\n\nelectron is

case AB = CB, B!=0, but A != C\nsame case for identity matrices as well. you CANNOT assume an unknown matrix is the identity matrix.\n\nmatrix division §\n\nthere is no concept of matrix division but

that A×A−1=I - blah blah blah rearrange expression you get (for the 2x2 case) - w=ad−bcd​ and blah blah for x, y, z\ntherefore: for A=(ac​bd​),A−1=ad−bc1​(d−c​−ba​)\n\n(ad-bc) is the determinant of A,

This reduced the accuracy of the experiment and is therefore a systematic error.\n\n\nAs substance is heated, electrons become excited, as they gain energy the electrons can transition into a higher energy state.\nBecause the electrons are in a higher energy state, they are unstable. So they quickly transition back to their ground state, which emits photons with specific wavelengths (equal to the diff in energy levels)\nTherefore, the photons have specific wavelengths, and the specific wavelengths mean specific colours are observed.\nSince excited electrons can transition to their ground state in multiple stages, a set of diff photons of diff wavelengths can be emitted.\n\nThis means a spectra of different wavelengths of light is noticed.\n\n\nThis test is only valid for some metals, as most non-metals emit frequencies outside of visible spectrum, and cannot be identified.\n\nWhat can the test be used for §\n\nIonic salts: simple ionic solids and metals can be used.\nBecause when heated, the metal ions and anions separate, producing emission within visible spectrum.\n\nweaknesses of flame test §\n\nthe test cannot detect low concentrations of most ions.\nsalt metal may not be excited by relatively low temperature of the ethanoal flame (magnesium)\nsalt may not be completely excited (diff colour being observed)\ndoes not work with most non metals\nethanol and oxygen may get involved, changing the observed colour.\nThe brightness of the signal varies from one sample to another. For example, the yellow emission from sodium is much brighter than the red emission from the same amount of lithium.\nImpurities or contaminants affect the test results. Sodium, in particular, is present in most compounds and will colour the flame. Sometimes a blue glass is used to filter out the yellow of sodium.\nThe test cannot differentiate between all elements. Several metals produce the same flame colour.

The film explores themes of isolation and violence. The story follows Kya, a girl who spends most of her life alone in the marsh due to rejection by society, who winds up being the primary suspect of a murder case. Kya’s “righteous” motive draws similarities to Owens’ personal experiences, in which the death of multiple animal poachers is allegedly the fault of Owens. Through the understanding of the film and its context I as the contemporary audience develop an empathetic but critical response to the actions of the murderer.\nBody Paragraph 1 §\n\ncharacterisation: the characterisation of Kya, a nature loving independent and isolated girl who will do anything to achieve her goals, including murder, parallels Delia Owens, a nature loving conservationist who would protect against poachers at any cost.\nboth characters are strong female heroines.\nthis developed my response of appreciation of their resolve to protect their peace and isolation at any cost, but im critical towards the fact they value the upkeep of nature to a human life, and their view that you can only have one, but not the other.\n\nBody Paragraph 2 §\n\nenvironment: the large marsh which sees more animals than humans is parallel to the environment of zambia which mark and delia owens lived.\nlike how delia adored africa, kya adored the marsh, both appreciating the solitude and isolation it provides, as well how the nature in it functions.\nthis constructs my response to understand that the environment can change the direction of a moral compass. people raised in normal society, who interacts with other humans values lives over anything else, but the marsh and african environment, in which perpetual life cycles of living and dying could be found anywhere and everywhere allows me to understand why kya and delia owens appreciate the company of animals, and do not put a higher value on human lives as others do.\n\nBody Paragraph 3 §\n\nvalues of murder: kya and delia owens, under the impact of environment and characterisation, both view murder as a “way of life”.\nkya doesn’t hesitate in murdering chase andrews, and manages to elaborately set up a plan and execute it to perfection, whilst delia owens allows and actively trains game scouts to take down and capture poachers with her husband and son mark and christopher owens.\n\nconclusion §\n\nR\n\nI as the audience develop an empathetic but critical response to the actions of Kya.\n\n\n\nI §\n\nP\n\nOwens effectively portrays Kya as a character to feel empathetic towards. It is significant for authors to allow the reader to believe in the protagonist, so the protagonist resonates with the reader. Owens effectively does this\n\n\n\n** treat Kya as a character in a story. Not as an actual person.\n**** focus on the how of Kya’s portrayal - is it through metalanguage, dialogue, narration **what** does the narrator use to assist him in portraying Kya?"},"notes/archive/AEold/english/WTCS-PRAC2":{"title":"WTCS-PRAC2","links":[],"tags":["ae","english"],"content":"1.     Discuss how your attitudes influence your response to the way a controversy is represented in at least one text.\nResponses are affected by the reader’s attitudes and how the text conveys certain ideas, such as if the text establishes context. This is underlined in the film “Where the Crawdads Sing” (2022) directed by Olivia Newman from screenplay by Lucy Alibar adapted from the novel of the same name. The film follows a coming-of-age story of an isolated girl named Kya, who is raised in the marsh and is suspected of the murder of a man she was once romantically involved with. My attitudes as the contemporary audience towards ideas of discrimination, isolation and relationships influence my response and positions me to be empathetic towards Kya in the representation of a murder case as the controversy.\nAs the contemporary attitude, my critical attitude towards discrimination influences my response to be condemning towards the accusation and the townspeople, believing they are motivated by prejudice and bias common in 1950s America rather than justice. The prejudice against Kya is highlighted with the townspeople always referring to Kya as “the marsh girl.” This label marks Kya as nothing other than her origins, something she cannot change. The label placed on Kya is similar to slurs against people based on their origin that is now shunned in contemporary society. The societal criticism of discrimination is much more different than 1950s America, where there are less consequences and seen as less serious. This labelling of Kya based on her origins, something she cannot change, influences my response to be empathetic towards Kya when she is accused of murder. [evidence 2, elaboration 2 goes here]. [link goes here]\nMy response to the representation of the controversy of the murder is influenced by my solemn (?) attitude towards isolation. Kya, ever since a young age has experienced isolation, not at her own fault, but the situation she was born in led eventually to her entire family one after the other abandoning the marsh, and consequentially, Kya (too long how to shorten). Kya reflects on this by stating that she “had a family once” who “called [her] Kya.” The use of past tense in “once” and “called” shows that Kya no longer has a family, nor does she have someone who calls by her real name, highlighting her loss of identity as Kya, and is now seen more as a “marsh girl” (should’ve used this for BP1 lmao). This is significant in influencing my response, as when she was revealed to be the murderer, my attitudes towards isolation influences my response to be empathetic, as the isolation she experienced and her exposure to the nature may present Kya a different viewpoint on life and death than everybody else, seeing it as an eventual constant rather than something to grieve over. [link and more bps here]\nFurthermore, my response to the murder case is influenced by my attitude towards relationships, in which I believe personal connection is an essential need contemporary context, in which social media and the growing connection with the technological word has led to a time where society is embedded more in social connection than any other time period of history. This is evidenced when Kya begged Tate to “please stay”, as she does not want to experience isolation again. In the contemporary context, where social media and every day the world gets more connected online, my attitude on social connection is that it is a basic human necessity and something everyone wishes to attain. This attitude further develops my empathy towards Kya in the trial, as she did not have the human connections relative to everybody else to learn what is socially acceptable and rather her environment of the marsh has shaped her character and perspective on life. When Tate doesn’t come back when he promised, Kya came to the realisation that “people don’t stay”, and she “had to do life alone” this shows although Kya wishes for social connection, those who are close to her consistently abandoned her eventually, to a point she feels she naturally undeserving of companionship (quote should go here). My attitude on the necessity of social connection furthers my empathetic response towards Kya. Hence, through my contemporary attitude on the necessity of social connection my response is empathetic towards Kya’s situation, because people she had connections with eventually abandoned her. (maybe unneeded last part)\nAs a contemporary reader, my attitudes on discrimination, isolation and social connection influences my response to be overall empathetic towards Kya. My critical attitude on discrimination, solemn attitude towards isolation, and the attitude on social connection, viewing it as a basic necessity everyone wishes to attain, all influences my response to be empathetic towards Kya. The portrayal of Kya as innocent and empathised towards the contemporary audience is significant in establishing that contextual information and backstory may change the perception and response by readers.\nGeneral observations\n-       Very very weak evidence, not enough ratio in terms of evidence to analysis. (what is the correct evidence analysis ratio?)\n-       Elaboration too complex and repetitive maybe.\n-       Needs link\n-       Expand body paragraphs 1,2\n-       Topic ideas are less overarching and seemingly develops as the essay develops rather than an umbrella concept (idk if this makes sense)\n-       Empathetic response is overused (used for all of them), maybe think of something else.\n-       Identifying main points in conclusion seems kind of weak\n-       Weak pointing of significance of tet\nExplain how at least one text conforms to generic conventions while still challenging its audience.\nFollowing conventions of genres is important, but to be distinct and create a piece of media that offers a new perspective, texts should subvert areas of genre to bring on new ideas. The 2022 film “Where the Crawdads Sing” directed by Olivia Newman from screenplay by Lucy Alibar based on 2018 novel of the same name my Delia Owens challenges and subverts the detective fiction genre and ideas surrounding it. The film follows the coming-of-age story of a girl raised in the marsh called Kya, who is suspected to be the murderer of someone who she was once romantically involved with. The text although conforming to certain ideas of the detective fiction genre, such as creating characters common within a detective fiction and following a common structure of a detective fiction, as more information is revealed to the audience as the story progresses, subverts and challenges the protagonist not being actively involved in solving the murder, and rejecting the traditional detective fiction ending to challenge or surprised the audience.\n“Where the Crawdads Sing” conforms to the detective fiction genre through generic conventions of characterisation but subverts and challenges the audience by making the protagonist not involved with solving the murder, but the suspect. The victim of the story is Chase Andrews, and the film conforms to the detective fiction genre by describing the details and specificity of his death, whilst also providing information on Chase Andrews, such as describing him as “the star quarterback of town” through an alternative timeline of the past which the film switches between. The characterisation of the victim and providing details similar to other detective fiction allows the contemporary audience a chance to figure out the mystery using provided clues to race against detectives and police officers in the novel. However, the text challenges the detective fiction genre by characterising Kya as not a prodigy or wise detective, but a young girl who is suspected of the crime. This challenges the traditional detective fiction approach, in which the protagonist is often a young prodigy or old experienced eccentric detective. This challenges the audience expectations, as although giving a greater insight to what happened, the recollections of the past may be from an unreliable narrator, which subverts from the standard of how detective cases are presented for the audience to solve, in which detectives can make more unbiased judgements. Thus, through the text’s utilisation of characterisation, “Where the Crawdads Sing” conforms to the detective fiction’s characterisation of the victim by developing his backstory and details of death but subverts and challenges the contemporary audience by making the protagonist the suspect rather than the detective.\nFurthermore, the text utilises narrative conventions of plot to conform to the detective fiction genre through following a linear storyline in relation to time and reveals more information and clues as the story progresses, but challenges audiences and expectations by rejecting the traditional ending within detective fiction to surprise the audience. The film switches back and forth between two-time periods of before the murder occurred, from when Kya was a child, and the aftermath, in which Kya was held at trial. The film uses the past to provide contextual information and clues on the murder, whilst the trial shows the ongoing decision that the jury will come to. This format allows the audience to intake information as film progress and allow them to make an educated decision on what the cause of the death of Chase Andrews was, which conforms to the detective fiction genre which slowly displaces clues and information about the case before the detective comes to a final conclusion, finding the murderer, or in this case determining if the suspect is guilty or not. However, the text subverts expectations by not revealing the actual murder, but instead hints in the ending that Kya was the one who did it, with her leaving a letter of confession right before passing away. This is different from traditional detective fiction endings, in which justice is served to the criminal, and everyone gets a happy ending. This challenges the audience to feel outraged at the fact that the murderer wasn’t condemned, unlike other detective fiction tales. Hence, through the employment of narrative conventions of plot, the detective fiction generic convention of slowly revealing clues as the story progresses is conformed, but challenges the audience when Kya was revealed to be the murderer, and the audience discovers that justice was not served.\nIn conclusion, “Where the Crawdads Sing” directed by Olivia Newman from screenplay by Lucy Alibar based on 2018 novel of the same name by Delia Owens subverts and challenges the traditional ideas surrounding the detective fiction genre. While conforming to certain conventions of the genre, the film challenges the protagonist’s passive role in solving the murder and rejects the typical detective fiction ending to surprise and challenge the audience. By doing so, the film offers a unique perspective on justice and the criminal justice system. This text ultimately highlights the importance of challenging and subverting traditional ideas and genres to offer new and unique perspectives on familiar concepts.\nideas\n-       Human connection &amp; independence\no   “please stay”\n§  Kya begs of Tate to “please stay”, highlighting her inner yearning for human connection and companionship. The desire for emotional support and closeness is further emphasised by the desperation in her voice and the vulnerability in her body language.\no   “I don’t know if anyone really knows me”.\n§  Kya states that she doesn’t know “if anybody really knows [her]”. This expresses her isolation and feeling disconnected with everything around her and reveals Kya’s doubts on if there is anybody out there who understands her.\no   “I had to do life alone… people don’t stay”.\n§  Kya reflects on her experience of abandonment by stating that she “had to do life alone”, and people in her life “don’t stay”. This statement highlights Kya’s loneliness and her struggles to form lasting connections with others. Her innate realisation people don’t stay suggest a sense of despair, and that all her life she never had the chance to experience a lasting human connection.\n-       Prejudice\no   “They call you the marsh girl…where you been, marsh hen?… where’s your hat swamp rat?”\n§  Marsh girl, marsh hen, swamp rat\n§  Throughout the story, Kya is subjected to ridicule and ostracism because of her isolation and poverty, as evidenced when the townspeople use derogatory names such as “marsh girl”, “marsh hen”, and “swamp rat.” These epithets reduce Kya’s identity to a mere label and reinforces the idea that she is inferior to others, and does not deserve formal education, respect or dignity.\no   “I never hated them, they hated me.”\n§  Kya stating that she “never hated them”, but “they hated” her highlights that although she was ostracised and judged by the people of her community because of her isolation and poverty, she never harboured any hate towards them, but is instead the victim of prejudice, underscoring the ways discrimination can harm those who did nothing wrong.\no   “They’re not deciding anything about me. It’s them. They are judging themselves.”\n§  Kya reflects on the ostracization she received and determined that the prejudice against her isn’t “deciding anything about” her, but instead the townspeople are “judging themselves.” She recognises that that townspeople judgement and prejudice are saying more about themselves than they are about her. This characterisation shows Kya’s developed self-acceptance, in which Kya is able to find resilience in the face of adversity.\n-       Nature // The marsh\no   “It’s like having a friend your whole life but you never see their face”.\n§  Kya’s statement, “It’s like having a friend your whole life but you never see their face” highlights the power of nature and the deep connection that individuals can feel with their surroundings. Kya has grown up in the marsh, where she has developed a profound bond with the natural world around her. Her statement suggests that this connection is as deep and meaningful as a friendship, despite the fact that it does not involve human interaction.\no   “the only constant in nature is change”\n§  In Where the Crawdads Sing, the statement “the only constant in nature is change” reflects the idea that everything in the natural world is subject to transformation and evolution. This statement is particularly significant for Kya, who has grown up in the marsh and has developed a deep understanding of the natural world around her. Her experiences have taught her that the environment is constantly shifting and adapting, and that individuals must be willing to accept and adapt to these changes.\no   “the marsh knows all about death.”\n§  In Where the Crawdads Sing, the statement “the marsh knows all about death” reflects the idea that nature is intimately connected with the cycle of life and death. Kya has grown up in the marsh, and is disconnected from her community, so she has developed a deep understanding of the natural world around her. Her experiences have taught her that death is a natural and necessary part of life, and that the marsh is both a site of birth and of decay.\nExplore how at least one text reveals that the values and attitudes of an individual or group are shaped by their circumstances.\nStylistic choices -&gt; genre\nLanguage features -&gt; film conventions"},"notes/archive/AEold/english/WTCS-THE-OTHER":{"title":"WTCS-THE-OTHER","links":[],"tags":["ae","english"],"content":"the concept of the other §\n\nbroad term that refers to individuals or groups who are been seen on the margins.\noutside of mainstream or what is considered normal\nthe other is usually represented as different, but as inferior, less powerful and worthy.\nkya for example is represented as someone who the townspeople think doesn’t deserve compassion, education or a family.\n\nrelation to values and attitudes and ideologies. §\n\nfor example in western society, we value and respect others, need a job to work hard and make money, and value ideas about family and education.\n\nbinary oppositions §\n\nsense of self and other are binary oppositions.\nthe self and the other are social constructs that involve a power difference.\n\npolitics §\n\nrapid changes in technology and social demographics through migration and globalisation has redefined dominant culture and what it means to be a member of mainstream media.\n\nhow to construct others §\n\nothers are often people who are romanticised, feared, stereotyped or pitied - someone who is different.\nkya is WTCS is feared, pitied, excluded and scorned.\n\ngender §\n\nthe idea of an independent female, rare in the 1960s leads to kya being see as an other, as she is different from other women of the same time period.\n\noutsiders §\n\noutsider is a popular character type who is earned by those who exist outside the norm of dominant spheres of identity.\n"},"notes/archive/AEold/english/WTCS-VALUES-ATTITUDES":{"title":"WTCS-VALUES-ATTITUDES","links":[],"tags":["ae","english"],"content":"values and attitudes §\n\nvalues and attitudes are embedded in texts (visual, written and multimodal texts)\nvalues are what individuals or groups think are important and hold to be worth (e.g. justice, honesty, education)\ndominant values are those values that are widely shared among a group, community, or culture in a particular context.\nattitudes are the positions held or responses an individual or group make, as a result of their values.

because the force is only experienced when contact is maintained.\n\nforces acted upon the body at a distance are non-contact forces.\n\n\na force is measured in newtons\n\n1. an object in motion stays in motion (maintain constant velocity) unless an unbalanced, external force acts upon it (the object). §\n\nthe term maintains a constant velocity implies that, if the object is moving, then it will continue to move with a velocity that has the same magnitude and direction. e.g. a car moving 12m/s south after a set amount of time will still be moving at 12m/s (this is also consistent with zero velocity)\nunless implies an otherwise for the non-continuation of a constant velocity, and is shown through an unbalanced acting force.\nterminal velocity is the state of time when the speed a skydiver falls is equal to the air resistance, such the skydiver is unable to gain acceleration without changing anything such as mass or shape.\n\ninertia §\n\nthe law is expanded upon with inertia.\ninertia is considered to be the resistance to a change in motion of an object.\nas the mass of an object increases, inertia increases.\ninertia causes:\n\nharder to start moving a stationery object.\nharder to stop moving a object with a velocity.\nharder to change the direction of motion.\nthis can be demonstrated in real life through shopping carts.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. force = mass x

force. §\n\nwhen hammer hits nail, the nail and the hammer both experience forces.\n\nthe force experienced by hammer is relative to the force experienced by the nail.\nthis observation follows newton’s third law. stating every force has an equal and opposing force.\n\n\nin a collision of a large bus and a small car, the force both experiences are the same.\n\nbut due to the difference in mass, one has a higher acceleration, whilst the other has a lower acceleration.\n\n\nthis is true for gravity as well - called the normal force.\n\nabbreviated as FN​ or N\n\n\n\nfree body diagram

Specifically, the relationship of concentration and effect on rate of reaction in an acid neutralisation reaction between hydrochloric acid and calcium carbonate.\nTo identify the relationship between concentration of acid and rate of reaction, we need to have a look at collision theory. The theory states that, for a chemical reaction to occur:\n1.     The reacting molecules must collide with one another.\n2.     The collisions must occur with enough energy to disrupt the bonds in the reactants (known as activation energy – ).\n3.     The molecules must collide with the correct orientation.\nThis combined with the Kinetic Theory helps us draw the relationship between concentration of acid and rate of reaction. The theory states that all matter is composed of small particles, which is always in constant motion.\nConcentration measures the number of particles in a certain volume of a solution. When concentration increases, there will be a greater number of reactant particles in each volume. According to the Kinetic Theory, the constant motion of atom will lead to an increased number of collisions between particles. As a result, this will increase the frequency of collisions of reactants between a given time. Although the percentage of collisions that are successful (requirements 2 and 3) are the same, higher frequency of collisions will lead into an increased number of successful collisions, which increases the rate of reaction.\nWhen hydrochloric acid encounters calcium carbonate calcium carbonate, water and carbon dioxide are formed. This is shown in the following net ionic equation for the reaction we will be performing.\n\nAim §\nUse collision theory to explain the effect of changing concentration on the rate of reaction.\nHypothesis §\nIf the concentration of the reactant, hydrochloric acid is increased, the rate of reaction will increase.\nIndependent Variable: concentration of the reactant, . §\nDependent Variable: rate of reaction of the production of . §\nControlled Variables: §\n-       Acid used.\n-        \nEquipment &amp; Chemicals §\n-       2L ice cream tub “trough”\n-       delivery tube\n-       250mL measuring cylinder\n-       conical flask\n-       bung/stopper/plug that fits the conical flask\n-       timer\n-       2g marble chips of calcium carbonate\n-       25mL of hydrochloric acid\nDiagram §\nMethod §"},"notes/temperatureBehaviour":{"title":"behaviour of temperatures","links":[],"tags":["ae","chemistry"],"content":""},"notes/trighardquestions":{"title":"trighardquestions","links":[],"tags":["ae","specialist","questions","trigonometry"],"content":"\ntoday we are looking at hard questions in trig 4 spec\nex 4c §\nshow that cos70+sin40=cos10\nno formula for it :(\ndo we give up?\nno\n\nNever back down never WHAT!!!!!!\nrearrange: cos70−cos10=−sin40\ndont assume its true to begin with\nheres how to write it:\nconsider cos70−cos10\n=−2sin270+10​sin270−10​\n=−2sin40sin30\n=−sin40\n12b §\nsolve sin5θ−sin3θ+sinθ=0 for 0≤θ≤x\n2cos(25θ+3θ​)sin(25θ−3θ​)\n2cos4θsinθ+sinθ=0\nsinθ(2cos4θ+1)=0\nsinθ=0 or 2cos4θ+1=0\nθ=0 or π and cos4π=−21​\n4θ=32π​,34π​,38π​,310π​\nθ=6π​,3π​,32π​,65π​"},"notes/七五三":{"title":"七五三","links":[],"tags":["japanese","presentation","ae"],"content":"research for the presentation in class (2-3 slides long)\n子どもの大切な通過儀礼のひとつ、七五三\n\nimportant rite of passage for children\n通過儀礼、つうかぎれい: rite of passage\n大切、たいせつ: important\nAHHHHHHHHHh\n"},"tags/ae":{"title":"ae","links":[],"tags":["tags"],"content":""},"tags/chemistry":{"title":"chemistry","links":[],"tags":["tags"],"content":""},"tags/english":{"title":"english","links":[],"tags":["tags"],"content":""},"tags/japanese":{"title":"japanese","links":[],"tags":["tags"],"content":""},"tags/methods":{"title":"methods","links":[],"tags":["tags"],"content":""},"tags/physics":{"title":"physics","links":[],"tags":["tags"],"content":""},"tags/specialist":{"title":"specialist","links":[],"tags":["tags"],"content":""}}
