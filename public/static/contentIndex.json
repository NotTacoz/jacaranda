This causes a pressure to be exerted on the walls of the container, that is, a force per unit area.\nTLDR: It is a force\ngases consist of particles in constant random motion, spread a long way apart.\nWhen gases collide with the walls of their container, each collision exerts a force. This causes a pressure to b exerted on the walls of the container, that is, a force per unit area.\nPressure is measured in Pascals, 1 Pa = 1 N/m2\nWe also measure pressure in atmospheres, where 1 atm = 101.3kPa\n\nKinetic Theory of Gases §\n\nThe kinetic theory of gases links the macroscopic behaviour of a gas with its microscopic behaviour.\n\nIn macroscopic terms, a gas is a phase of matter that has a fixed mass and whose values is equal to the volume of its container. The gas exerts pressure on the walls of the container.\nIn microscopic terms, a gas is a collection of many particles that collide with each other and the container walls.\n\n\nThe kinetic theory relates the pressure exerted by a gas to the motion of its particles.\nThe kinetic theory of gases was developed from experimental evidence to explain the similar behaviours of all gases.\nMathematical relationships between pressure, volume, moles and temperature have been derived for an ideal gas, that is, a gas that obeys all the equations perfectly.\nThere is no such thing as an ideal gas- no real gases behave exactly as the laws describe. However, under normal conditions, almost all gases follow the ideal gas model very closely.\nReal gases deviate most from ideal gas behaviour at very low temperatures and very high pressures.\nGases with small particles like hydrogen and helium follow the ideal gas laws most closely.\n\nSince they have smaller particles, and less interactions between particles.\n\n\n\nIdeal Gas Assumptions §\n\nWhen describing an ideal gas, the following assumptions are made:\n\nthe motion of all particles is random.\nall particles travel in straight lines.\nany forces of attractions (intermolecular, electrostatic, and gravitational forces) are negligible.\nall particles of the same gas are identical, and perfect spheres.\nthe internal energy of the gas is entirely kinetic.\nall collisions between particles and the walls of the container are completely elastic (there is no loss of energy).\nparticles take up negligible volume (pressure is due to mobility).\nnewton’s law of motion apply (for every opposite action, there is an equal and opposite reaction etc).\n\n\n\nKinetic Energy and Temperature §\n\nImportant aspect of kinetic energy is that:\n\ntemperature is related to average kinetic energy of the particles.\nhowever, there is a range of kinetic energy values for the particles at any particular temperature - some move faster and some move slower than average.\n\n\nmaxwell-boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of kinetic energies of particles at a given temperature.\n\ny axis is number of particles molecules in a sample.\nx axis is the kinetic energy (E)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKinetic Energy &amp; Particle Velocity\nKE = 1/2 mv^2 (we dont need to do calculations with the formula AT ALL)\nparticle with greater mass will have a lower average velocity.\n\nMeasuring Temperature §\n\nabsolute or thermodynamic scale of temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles. It is measured in degrees Kelvin (K). When the temperature is measured in Kelvin, the temperature of a substance is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of its particles.\nAbsolute temperature starts at absolute zero - the theoretical lowest possible temperature, at which points the particles would have no kinetic energy. The absolute scale has units of the same magnitude as the Celsius scale. Absolute zero cannot be reached.\nConverting to and from Kelvin and degrees Celsius:\n\nT(K)=T(°C)+273.15\n\n\n\nPowerpoint 2: The Gas Laws §\n\nHOW gases behave?\nhow can it be predicted by The Kinetic Theory.\n\nKinetic Theory states that ALL matter consists of tiny particles that are in constant (random) motion (movement)\n\n\n\nReal vs Ideal Gases §\nReal Gases §\n\ndo have volume\nare attractions between particles\ncan condense or solidify\n\nIdeal Gases §\n\nno volume\nno attraction between particles.\nfollows gas laws at all temperatures &amp; pressures.\n\nDifference §\n\nreal gases differ most from ideal gas at low temps and high pressures\n\n4 Descriptors of Gas §\n\nPressure\nTemperature\nVolume\nNumber of particles\nthese 4 things can completely describe a gas to measure 4 things.\n\nWorksheet §\n\nwe did a worksheet on the ideal gas laws.\n\nbrownian moton\nboyles law\ncelcius and kelvin\nabsolute zero\npressure and temeprature\n\n\n\n5020 wall collision/5ps\n\n"

    "content": "Electrical Circuits: Investigation of Internal Resistance of Batteries\nYear 11 Physics - Thomas Han 2023\nEMF, Internal resistance, Terminal Potential Difference and Lost Volts\nDevices supplying electrical energy are called electric sources. The main power source in our experiment is a power supply, specifically a battery.\nThe electromotive force (EMF), E, of a source is the energy supplied to each coulomb of charge which passes through the source. It is commonly measured in volts, V. (Physics, Mr Mitchell, 2023)\nConsider the circuit below which has a battery, a voltmeter, load resistor, R, and switch, S.\n\n(Fig 1: a basic circuit featuring a battery, a voltmeter, load resistor and as which made from tools at circuit-diagram.org)\nWhen the switch is open, the circuit is called an open circuit, where no current is flowing. In this scenario, the voltmeter gives the EMF. If the battery was 6V, the voltmeter in an open circuit would show 6V.\nHowever, when the switch is closed, current is able to flow through the circuit. In the real world, as all materials have some sort of resistance, the power supply must have its own resistance, called the internal resistance, r. This means we can model a power supply of electrical energy (battery) in series with a small resistance (internal resistance), as show in Fig 2.\n\n(Fig 2: Real Source)\nIn a closed circuit with a battery with an internal resistance, if we attempt to measure the volts, the measured volts will usually be lower than volts output by the battery. The voltmeter connected to the variable supply measures the potential difference, Vtpd.\nIf we link our power supply without a circuit, (the switch is turned off), there is no current to the battery, and we can get our maximum voltage. (The Physics Classroom, 2022)\n·       When current is drawn from an electrical source, some energy is wasted inside the source due to its internal resistance. This is referred to as the lost vaults, Vlost.\n\n·       This means that there is less voltage available to the load resistor, R. The voltage available at the terminals of the electrical source, and therefore across the load resistor, is called the terminal potential difference (tpd), Vtpd.\n\n·       By conservation of energy,\n\nor\n\nwhere:\n-       E is the electromotive force measured in Volts (V).\n-       V is terminal potential difference measured in Volts (V).\n-       I is current measured in Amperes (A).\n-       R is internal resistance measured in ohms (Ω).\nThe equation can be rewritten as and factorised into .\nQuestions\nQ. If a source (battery) had zero internal resistance what would happen if the battery was shorted out?\nIf a battery with zero internal resistance is shorted out (connected directly with a wire across its terminals), theoretically, an infinite amount of current would flow through the circuit. This is because the internal resistance of the battery is responsible for limiting the current that flows through it. With zero internal resistance, there would be no resistance to the flow of electrons, resulting in an extremely high current.\nQ. If we measure the voltage of the source when current flow is zero, what is the PD across this resistance and how would voltage measured compare to the emf?\nIf you measure the voltage of the source when there is zero current flowing through it (open circuit conditions), you would be measuring the electromotive force (emf) of the source. This is because the entire voltage drop would occur across the source itself, and none across any internal resistance. So, the voltage measured in this scenario would be equal to the EMF of the source.\nQ. Voltmeters have a high resistance but not infinite, is it possible to get a 100% accurate reading of emf using a voltmeter?\nWhile voltmeters have high resistance, they are not truly infinite in resistance. In practical terms, they have very high resistance compared to the components they are connected to, and this minimizes the current drawn from the circuit being measured. This is done to ensure that the voltmeter doesn’t significantly affect the circuit it’s measuring.\nHowever, due to the finite resistance of the voltmeter, it will draw a small amount of current from the circuit it’s measuring, and this can cause a slight voltage drop across the internal resistance of the source. This means that when you measure the voltage across the terminals of the source using a voltmeter, you might measure a value slightly lower than the actual emf of the source.\nPost-Lab Discussion\n1.     Use a graphical method to obtain emf and r from either slopes or intercepts of your raw or manipulated data. How do these values compare with the values you obtained by direct measurement?\nThe internal resistance, r, is the absolute value of the slope of the graph.\nGreen r is 1.7 ohms, Yellow r is 1.6 ohms, Red r is 2.9 ohms.\nThe emf can be found by the y intercepts of our data. Using the graph, we draw a line of best fit and measure the y intercepts, we find that:\nGreen emf is 5.6 volts, Yellow emf is 5.5 ohms, Red emf is 5.3 ohms.\n2.     How do the emf and internal resistance of a flat dry cell compare with those of a fresh dry cell?\nOver time the conductivity of the cell contents decreases, thus increasing the internal resistance of the cell. The instantaneous EMF drops too; but the standard cell EMF does not as the standard EMF depends on electrolyte used. (Kundu, 2017)\n3.     How does the internal resistance of an alkaline battery compare with that of a heavy-duty battery of the same size and shape?\nGenerally, alkaline batteries have lower internal resistance compared to heavy-duty batteries of the same size and shape. Alkaline batteries can deliver energy more efficiently, and heavy-duty batteries, on the other hand, tend to have higher internal resistance, making them less suitable for applications that require higher currents or consistent power output. (Machine Design, 2022)\n4.     The battery in a torch has been used for a long time. Explain why the torch is dim even though the emf of each cello is the same as when they were first bought.\nAs a battery in a torch is used over time, its internal resistance increases, causing voltage drops and reduced energy delivery. The battery stores a finite amount of chemicals, which deplete as energy is being used. When the chemicals become low in quantity, reactions will become negligible, and electricity available also becomes negligible. This is the discharging process of battery, causing the light to be dimmer. (Deshpande, 2018)\n5.     Does a power pack have internal resistance? Explain your answer.\nYes. All power supplies have some resistance between their terminals called internal resistance. This causes charges in the circuit to dissipate some electrical energy in the power supply itself. The power supply becomes warm when delivering a current. (O’Hanlon, n.d.) Materials used in power sources are not perfect conductors. Microscopic impurities, crystal defects, and other imperfections within materials can create localized areas of higher resistance.\nBibliography §\nDeshpande, R. (2018). When a battery in a torch is used for several weeks, the light from its bulb becomes dim. We say that the battery or cell is discharged. What does it mean?

in a battery this is achieved by using one chemical that craves electrons and another that is happy to release them.\nan emf will drive an electric current around a closed circuit. the charged particles will naturally move to a lower potential as they are attached to the opposite charge on the far side of the circuit.\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Note \n                  \n                \nenergy in = energy out\n\n\n12.0 -&gt;

Electric fields then have more influence on the electrons.\nresistivity of material is larger: part of the intrinsic behaviour iron -&gt; copper -&gt; silver\n\n\n\nenergy loss in a resistor §\n\nwhen a current flows through a circuit element with a resistance, a potential difference will exist across that element (Ohm’s law) V = IR.\na potential difference is a measure of the drop in ‘potential energy per coulomb’\nas a current flows through a resistor, there needs to be a change in energy of the charged particles that are flowing through.\nthis is confirmed using a voltmeter that will measure that there is a potential difference.\n\nwhere will this energy go? §\n\na current flowing through a resistive element will produce heat. This might be desirable, or simply a form of wasted energy.\ntransfer of kinetic energy (movement of particles)\ne.g. toaster -&gt; drive a current through a metal bar -&gt; current due to resistance will release heat energy.\n\nV-I profiles (HELPFUL FOR INVESTIGATION) §\n\nwhen we analyse different circuit components, looking at the voltage-current profile, it helps us explain a particular component of the circuit.\nas we increase the voltage, the amount of current flowing through that element will also increase.\n\nin a resistor, this will provide a linear relationship.\n(ohmic resistor graph)\nwe can figure out the gradient if we analyse the graph.\ngradient = rise/run = change in current/change in voltage = I/V (ohms law flipped!!!)\nI/V is flipped ohms law, therefore, Resistance = 1/gradient.\nindicate points CLEARLY on the graph!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nin a voltage current profile for a resistor, the resistance = 1/gradient, the gradient is constant and therefore the resistance of the resistor is also a constant, therefore the resistance of the resistor is also a constant value - ohmic conductor.\nnon-ohmic conductor\n\na globe is not ohmic. Their resistance changes with respect to the voltage that is placed across them.\nif the resistance is 1/gradient and the resistance is changing, then the gradient is changing.\nnon-ohmic device can be identified from its voltage current profile, as the gradient will NOT be constant.\n\n\n\nkirchhoffs laws §\n\nkirchhoffs current law (KCL)\n\nthe sum of the currents flowing into a junction is equal to the sum of the currents flowing out.\nIT​=I1​+I2​\n\n\n4 things to think abt when looking at diagram (referring to series circuit):\n\nohms law\nkirchhoffs voltage law\nkirchhoffs current law\nequivalent resistance\n\n\n\n5.3 electric current and circuits §\n\nelectrical circuit is a path made of conductive material, through which charges can flow in a closed loop.\nmovement of electrons is called electron flow.\n\nCharge and Current: Problems Worksheet §\n\nObject X is known to have a net positive charge. Through experimentation the following was observed:\n\n\nObject X attracts object Y\nObject Y repels object Z\na. Explain, using the our current understanding of the atom, how object X could have gained a positive net charge.\nby having more protons that electrons\nb. Object X is placed near object Z. Would these two objects attract or repel each other?\nattract, because Object Y and Z have the same charge (since they repel each other), and object Y is attracted to object X (opposite charges), so object Z and X have opposing charges (attracting each other)\nc. When object X is placed near object Y it loses its net positive charge. Suggest the most likely reason why this occurs.\nbecause the net positive charge is counteracted by an equally negative charge.\n\n\nAfter moving around on carpet in socks, Jane reaches for a door knob and receives a static shock\na. Describe the physics behind the cause of a static shock.\n\n\nJane has a net negative charge because her body collected electrons, and the electrons are released when she touches the door knob.\nb. Explain how the conditions required for Jane to be shocked occurred.\nmetals conduct electricity, and the electrons stored in your body by collecting the electrons on the carpet is conducted by the metal doorknob, and felt as a “static shock”.\nc. On the diagram above, draw the charge distribution of Jane’s hand and the door knob just prior to the shock occurring (be careful with the ratio of positive and negative charges drawn).\nErm\n\n\nDuring a Van der Graff demonstration the metal dome builds up a large positive charge. The teacher places a single aluminium pie plate on top of the dome. After a while the pie plate flies off. Explain the cause behind the pie plate flying off.\n\nthe charge\n\n\nRubbing a balloon against dry hair allows the balloon to temporarily stick to a wall. Explain, using the diagram to assist, why the balloon sticks.\nThe charge of several objects was recorded into a table.

Non-metals do not conduct electricity very well and are known as insulators. Meanwhile silver and copper the outermost electrons are only very slightly attracted to their respective nuclei. As a consequence, metals are good conductors of electricity. In conductors, loosely held electrons can ‘jump’ from one atom to another and move freely throughout the material.\n\n\n\nknow absolute and percentage uncertainty for the test ^_^"

HOWEVER, diagnosis of cancerous growths inside the body, a variety of radioisotopes tagged to particular drugs are used.\nThe radioisotope is known as a radioactive tracer.\nThese drugs, radiopharmaceuticals, can be administered by swallowing (ingestion), inhalation or injection.\nA gamma-ray camera can be used to perform a bone scan.\n\nThis patient has been injected with the radioisotope technetium-99m (v commonly used)\n\ngamma emitter\nhalf life of 6 hours\n\n\nThe camera detects the emitted gamma-rays and produces an image on a computer screen.\n\n\nThe radioisotope used depends on the site of the suspected tumour.\nThe body naturally distributes different elements to different organs. For example, iodine is sent to the thyroid gland by the liver. So if a radiopharmaceutical containing radioactive iodine is ingested, most of this iodine will end up in the thyroid.\nWhen the tracer has reached the target organ, a radiation scan is taken with a gamma-ray camera.\nAn unusual pattern on the scan indicates a possible cancerous tumour. The radioisotopes used for this type of diagnosis need to be gamma-ray emitters so that the radiation has enough penetrating ability to pass out of the body to reach the detector—the gamma-ray camera.\nThe isotope should have a relatively short half-life so that the patient is not subjected to any unnecessary long-term exposure to radiation.\nRadioactive tracers are also used to monitor other bodily functions. Some examples are shown in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nradioactive tracerfunction monitorediodine-123function of thyroid glandxenon-133function of lungsphosphorous-32blood flow through bodyiron-59level of iron uptake by spleentechnetium-99mblood flow in brain, lungs and heart function of liver metabolism of bones\n\n\n nuclear power stations employ a variety of safety mechanisms to prevent nuclear accidents, including shielding, moderators, cooling\n\n\nFuel rods: long, thin rods containing pellets of enriched uranium\n\n\nModerator: material that slows down neutrons\n\nGraphite, water, heavy water, carbon dioxide\nHeavy water is the best but is too expensive\nWater with dueterium, (Hydrogen-2) an isotope of hydrogen\nGraphite and carbon dioxide contain carbon which is denser than hydrogen\nEnsures that neutron capture occurs\nWhen the neutrons collide with small nuclei, they lose most of their kinetic energy\n\n\n\nControl rods: material that absorbs neutrons\n\nBoron steel or cadmium\nEnsures energy release is controlled and stable, due to them controlling the amount of neutrons for fission\n\n\n\nCoolant: liquid to absorb heat energy that has been produced by nuclear fission, goes to cooling tower to cool down\n\ne.g. water\n\n\n\nRadiation shield (shielding): thick concrete wall that prevents neutrons/radiation/radioactive waste escaping from the reactor\n\n\n the management of nuclear waste is based on the knowledge of the behaviour of radiation.\n\n\nA major problem facing the nuclear power industry is the disposal of the unstable radioactive waste.\n\n\nRadioactive waste products are classified as low-level, intermediate level or high-level waste.\n\nLow-level waste is generated primarily from hospitals, industry and laboratories and consists mostly of tools, clothing, used wrapping material and other items that have been contaminated with radionuclides with short half-lives. Low-level waste solids are usually compacted or incinerated, then buried in shallow pits on land or at sea.\nIntermediate-level waste typically consists of reactor components, chemical sludges, and contaminated materials from reactors that have been decommissioned. Intermediate-level wastes are solidified in bitumen or concrete, then buried or stored in deep trenches.\nHigh-level waste is waste from contaminated reactor parts, as well as liquid waste from the reprocessing of spent fuel rods. This waste contains highly radioactive fission fragments and transuranic elements, and so requires special shielding during handling and transport. High-level waste remains radioactive for an exceedingly long time and needs to be stored permanently.\n\n\n\nBy way of comparison, the activity of one tonne of uranium ore is only 8 × 10^11Bq\n\n\nUranium-235 and uranium-238 nuclei in these fuel rods have half-lives of 700000 and 4.5 billion years respectively. The numerous fission fragments have a wide range of half-lives. The fuel rods must be permanently stored in cooling ponds inside nuclear power stations in order to protect people from the radioactive emissions. In Japan, Russia and Europe, the spent fuel rods are reprocessed. The uranium is extracted and reused as nuclear fuel. This is an expensive process.\nScience Understanding:\n\n\n the nuclear model of the atom describes the atom as consisting of an extremely small nucleus which contains most of the atom’s mass, and is made up of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons surrounded by negatively charged electrons\n\n\nliterally the check point, no extra info abt it i dont think\n\n\n nuclear stability is the result of the strong nuclear force which operates between nucleons over a very short distance and opposes the electrostatic repulsion between protons in the nucleus\n\n\nElectrostatic forces define protons as repelling each other, but in the nucleus, an external “strong nuclear force” needs to be considered which allows protons to be very close to other protons without repelling and breaking the nucleus apart.\n\n\nThe strong nuclear force is a force of attraction that holds the nucleus together and acts between every nucleon regardless of their charge. Protons are also attracted to nearby neutrons and protons.\n\n\nThis force only acts over relatively short distances so for nucleons on the opposite sides of a large nucleus, this force is not significant. In a stable nucleus, there is a delicate balance between the repulsive electric force and the attractive strong nuclear force.\n\n\n some nuclides are unstable and spontaneously decay, emitting alpha, beta (+/-) and/or gamma radiation over time until they become stable nuclides\n\n\nalpha decay §\nno notes, assumed prior knowledge\nbeta decay §\n\nsplit into b+ and b-\n\nbeta - §\n\nelectron is emitted from the nucleus of a radioactive atom.\nwritten as −10​β\noccurs if a nucleus has too many neutrons to be stable -&gt; a neutron spontaneously changes into a proton, a beta-minus particle (β−, an electron), and an uncharged massless antimatter particle called antineutrino v\n\nbeta + §\n\nproton spontaneously change into a neutron and emit a neutrino (v), and a positively charged beta particle.\npositively charged beta particle is called a positron, which has same properties as electron, but a positive electrical charge.\n\ngamma decay §\n\nexcess energy is released through a gamma ray, which is high-energy electromagnetic radiation with no mass, uncharged and travels at the speed of light.\n each species of radionuclide has a half-life which indicates the rate of decay\nN=N0​(21​)n, n=t1/2​t​\nN = quantity of substance remaining\nN0​ = initial quantity of the substance\nt = time elapsed\nt1/2 = half life of the substance\nn = half lives elapsed\n alpha, beta and gamma radiation have different natures, properties and effects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalphabeta-beta+gammaspeedrelatively slowup to 90% speed of light0.9cspeed of lightchargedouble posnegative chargepositive chargeno chargeionisationhigh ionising abilitymedium ionising abilitymedium ionising abilitypoor ionising abilitypenetrationpoor penetrating ability; only travels a few cm in air1mm sheet of aluminium can stop1mm sheet of aluminium can stophigh penetrating ability; requires a significantly thicker width of lead to stop.massheavylightlightnone\n\n the measurement of absorbed dose and dose equivalence enables the analysis of health and environmental risks\nabsorbed dose = mE​, dose equivalent = absorbed dose × quality factor\n Einstein’s mass/energy relationship relates the binding energy of a nucleus to its mass defect\nΔE=Δmc2\n Einstein’s mass/energy relationship also applies to all energy changes and enables the energy released in nuclear reactions to be determined from the mass change in the reaction\nΔE=Δmc2\n alpha and beta decay are examples of spontaneous transmutation reactions, while artificial transmutation is a managed process that changes one nuclide into another\n neutron-induced nuclear fission is a reaction in which a heavy nuclide captures a neutron and then splits into smaller radioactive nuclides with the release of energy\n a fission chain reaction is a self-sustaining process that may be controlled to produce thermal energy, or uncontrolled to release energy explosively if its critical mass is exceeded\n nuclear fusion is a reaction in which light nuclides combine to form a heavier nuclide, with the release of energy\n more energy is released per nucleon in nuclear fusion than in nuclear fission because a greater percentage of the mass is transformed into energy\n"

= (x&#039;, y&#039;) (e.g. (2, 5) reflected through the y-axis is (-2, 5))\n\t- you can describe these transformation by multiplying it by a 2x2 matrix.\n- First P = (x, y) is written as a column matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} x\\\\y\\end{bmatrix}$ \n### basic idea\n- start with (2, 3), to transform with $T=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; -2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n- $\\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;-2\\\\3&amp;1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\\\3 \\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix} -4\\\\9 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- so **(2, 3)** gets transformed to **(-4, 9)**\n- translation is not a linear transformation, because it does not satisfy the linear transformation&#039;s definition of &quot;the origin has to stay where it is&quot;, where if you translate the entire plane, the origin will move as well.\n- reflection is only a linear transformation if it is on the line of the origin, otherwise the position of the origin is changed.\n### how to find what kind of transformation a transformation matrix is (top secret pro tip 99.95% of matrix solvers dont know about)\n- say you have the transformation matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} 3&amp;0\\\\0&amp;1 \\end{bmatrix}$, take the arbitrary values of x and y and apply the transformation on it. $$\\begin{bmatrix} 3&amp;0\\\\0&amp;1 \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} x\\\\y \\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} 3x\\\\y \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n## Transformation Matrices: Ultimate Guide\n- Take the identity matrix $$\\begin{bmatrix} 1&amp;0\\\\0&amp;1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n- if you change $a$ in $\\begin{bmatrix} a&amp;0\\\\0&amp;1 \\end{bmatrix}$, if $a&gt;0$, horizontal dilation by $a$, if $a&lt;0$, reflection through y-axis combined with a horizontal dilation by a factor of $|a|$\n- if you change $b$ in $\\begin{bmatrix} 1&amp;b\\\\0&amp;1 \\end{bmatrix}$, a horizontal shear occurs, where the transformation is dependent on how far away the point is from the x-axis.\n-  if you change $c$ in $\\begin{bmatrix} 1&amp;0\\\\c&amp;1 \\end{bmatrix}$, a vertical shear occurs, where the transformation is dependent on how far away the point is from the y-axis.\n-  if you change $d$ in $\\begin{bmatrix} 1&amp;0\\\\0&amp;d \\end{bmatrix}$, if $d&gt;0$, vertical dilation by $d$, if $d&lt;0$, reflection through x-axis combined with a horizontal dilation by a factor of $|d|$\n\n## Rotation\n- observe that for a given matrix $A=\\begin{bmatrix} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\end{bmatrix}$, the following is true: \n$$\\begin{bmatrix} a&amp;b\\\\c&amp;d \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\0 \\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} a\\\\c \\end{bmatrix}$$\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} a&amp;b\\\\c&amp;d \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} 0\\\\1 \\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} b\\\\d \\end{bmatrix}$$\n- if you know where the two points $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ lands, you can identify the rotation.\nin a 90 degree rotation:\n- $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ lands on $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n- $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ lands on $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n- therefore the transformation matrix maps out to be: $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ -1 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n## HOW TO: Matrices for Arbitrary Reflections and Rotations (WTF!!!!)\n### general rotation\n- rotate a unit by $\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\degree$, the transformation matrix would be $\\begin{bmatrix} 0.5 &amp; -0.866 \\\\ 0.866 &amp; 0.5 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\t- interesting. but what is the pattern here?\n\t- let&#039;s go back to what we learnt prior, and define the transformation matrix as transformations of $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix}  1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n- the point $A=(1,0)$ would be transformed to $A&#039;=(\\cos \\theta,\\sin \\theta)$\n- the point $C = (0,1)$ would be transformed to $C&#039; = (-\\sin \\theta,\\cos \\theta)$\n- looks better with a graph - no wifi rn so just google &quot;a general rotation about the origin graph for matrices&quot; maybe comes up with a result lol xDDD ^\\_^\nTHEREFORE IT WOULD MAP TO\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} \\cos \\theta &amp; -\\sin \\theta \\\\ \\sin \\theta &amp; \\cos \\theta \\end{bmatrix}$$ where $\\theta$ is an anti-clockwise rotation about the origin.\n- THIS IS IN THE FORMULA BOOKLET! - NO NEED TO MEMORISE IT 8)\n\n### general reflection\n- once again, we need to find where the points A (1, 0) and B (0, 1) ends up after a reflection.\n- search up &quot;general reflection in a line that passes through the origin graph proof matrices&quot; for a graph.\n- the angle made with the x axis is twice the angle of the line of reflection (looks more obvious when you look at it), therefore (1, 0) maps to $(\\cos 2\\theta, \\sin 2 \\theta)$\n- C (0, 1) maps to $(\\sin 2 \\theta, - \\cos 2 \\theta)$ (wow!)\ntherefore the matrix for reflection is: $$\\begin{bmatrix} \\cos 2 \\theta &amp; \\sin 2 \\theta \\\\ \\sin 2 \\theta &amp; - \\cos 2 \\theta \\end{bmatrix}$$ where the reflection is in the line $y = x \\tan \\theta$\n- once again, this is in the formula sheet, no need to memorise it.\n\n## transformation matrices: combining transformation\n- consider $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{bmatrix}$ (dilation by 3) and $B = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ (rotation $90\\degree$ anti-clockwise around origin)\n- how do you find the single transformation matrices that follows the transformation of A proceeded by B?\n\t- matrix multiplication.\n- say you have the arbitrary values $\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}$, and it is transformed by A, then we get $A \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}$\n- then multiplying $A \\begin{bmatrix}  x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}$ by B changes $A \\begin{bmatrix}  x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}$ to $B(A \\begin{bmatrix}  x \\\\y \\end{bmatrix})$ which equals $BA \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}$\n&gt;[!Warning]\n&gt; \n&gt;NOTE THAT MULTIPLICATION IS IN REVERSE ORDER **A -&gt; B** IS **BA**\n\n## transformations of lines\n- all points on the line $y=2x-3$ are transformed by the matrix $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. Find the equation of the image line.\n\t- let $(a,2a-3)$ be a point on the line $y=2x-3$\n\t- then $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}  a \\\\ 2a - 3 \\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix} a + 4a - 6 \\\\ a \\end{bmatrix}$\n\t- $= \\begin{bmatrix} 5a - 6 \\\\ a \\end{bmatrix}$\n\t- the image of $(a,b)$ is $(x,y)$, where $x = 5a - 6$ and $y=a$.\n\t- but $x = 5y - 6$,\n\t- $y=\\frac{x+6}{5}=\\frac{1}{5}x+\\frac{6}{5}$"

This causes to heat the Earth’s atmosphere, which increases the average global temperature. Climate Change describes Long-term weather pattern, and with increased average global temperatures, wind currents are altered, extra ice melts, and as a result of the ice melting, the sea level rises. This causes the long-term weather pattern to be disrupted and become chaotic, which results in undesirable natural disasters such as higher bushfire rate and intensity, as well as a higher temperature throughout the globe.\nOrganic Chemistry §\nWhat is Organic Chemistry? §\n\nOrganic Chemistry is the study of Hydrocarbon compounds.\n\nFractional Distillation §\n\nCrude oil is an exceptionally valuable resource.\n\nProperties of a Black, Viscous, Thick and oozy liquid mixture.\nIt is a mixture of many different hydrocarbons compounds.\n\nHydrocarbon compounds contain different chain lengths.\n\nIntermolecular forces are forces between molecules\n\nThe greater the number of molecules (hence having a longer chain), the greater the intermolecular force.\nHydrocarbons with shorter chains have weaker intermolecular force.\nLess energy is to break/pull the shorter chained hydrocarbons. Vice versa.\n\nThe process of breaking is evaporation of the chains, by turning it from liquid to gas.\nHeat energy is used to break apart the hydrocarbons.\nA higher temperature is required to break apart longer chained hydrocarbons.\n\n\n\n\nIntramolecular forces are forces in molecules\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFractional Distillation is a separation process based on differing boiling points of different fractions.\n\nFraction: A group of crude oil constituents that has a similar boiling point.\n∴\n\n\nThrough this, it provides Hydrocarbons, which is used to manufacture many different chemicals and even plastics.\n\nFractional Distillation in Steps §\n\nIn a furnace, the crude oil is heated up to a very high temperature.\nThe hot oil, now mostly in vapour form is pumped into the fractionating column.\n\nThe fractionating column has a heat gradient.\n\nHot at the bottom, Cool at the top.\n\n\n\n\nHydrocarbons rise through the fractionating column (as gas) making their way through bubble caps in each tray.\nDepending on the boiling point, hydrocarbons will get to a same level in the fractioning column, condense, and be collected in a fractionating tray outside the column.\n\nThe fractionating tray is a tray of hydrocarbons that has condensed at the same temperature\nSame boiling point hydrocarbons will have the same temperature where their chains are converted from liquid to gas.\n\n\nHydrocarbons with similar boiling point are collected in the same try and become one fraction.\n\nTL:DR; Crude oil is a mixture of important hydrocarbons, and fractional distillation is the method used to separate the hydrocarbons in crude oil. Hydrocarbons move up the fractionating column, until each fraction turns into their respective liquid.\nUsage of different hydrocarbon fractions §\n\nPetrol\n\nFuel for cars.\n\n\nNaptha\n\nEssential ingredient for plastic, and other plastics.\n\n\nKerosine\n\nAircraft fuel.\n\n\nDiesel\n\nCars or vans.\n\n\nBitumen\n\nA mixture of large chained hydrocarbons used to lay road.\n\n\nButane\n\nThe gas that comes out of gas taps in the school classrooms.\n\n\n\nAlkanes, alkenes, alkynes, cycloalkanes, cycloalkenes §\n+functional groups and generale formula :)\n\n🗒️ Naming doesn’t yet account for isomers (covered in another section)\n\nAlkyl §\nMethyl CH3​\nEthyl C2​H3​\nPropyl C3​H7​\n\nQuestion: Compare saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons\nAnswer: Each carbon atom bonds with the maximum number of hydrogen atoms in a saturated Hydrocarbon.\n\n\nCompared to, an unsaturated hydrocarbon, where less than the maximum amount of hydrogen is bonded to carbons.\nSaturated hydrocarbons are relatively unreactive.

    "content": "experiment 8: flame test §\n\nA flame test is a visual way of demonstrating the different frequencies emitted when an electron emits photons and moves from a higher energy state to a lower energy state.\n\nProcedure §\n\n\n\nSample of the element/compound is introduced to a colourless, non-luminous flame.\n\nIn the experiment, we used ethanol, which was a coloured flame rather than a colourless one. This reduced the accuracy of the experiment and is therefore a systematic error.\n\n\nAs substance is heated, electrons become excited, as they gain energy the electrons can transition into a higher energy state.\nBecause the electrons are in a higher energy state, they are unstable. So they quickly transition back to their ground state, which emits photons with specific wavelengths (equal to the diff in energy levels)\nTherefore, the photons have specific wavelengths, and the specific wavelengths mean specific colours are observed.\nSince excited electrons can transition to their ground state in multiple stages, a set of diff photons of diff wavelengths can be emitted.\n\nThis means a spectra of different wavelengths of light is noticed.\n\n\nThis test is only valid for some metals, as most non-metals emit frequencies outside of visible spectrum, and cannot be identified.\n\nWhat can the test be used for §\n\nIonic salts: simple ionic solids and metals can be used.\nBecause when heated, the metal ions and anions separate, producing emission within visible spectrum.\n\nweaknesses of flame test §\n\nthe test cannot detect low concentrations of most ions.\nsalt metal may not be excited by relatively low temperature of the ethanoal flame (magnesium)\nsalt may not be completely excited (diff colour being observed)\ndoes not work with most non metals\nethanol and oxygen may get involved, changing the observed colour.\nThe brightness of the signal varies from one sample to another. For example, the yellow emission from sodium is much brighter than the red emission from the same amount of lithium.\nImpurities or contaminants affect the test results. Sodium, in particular, is present in most compounds and will colour the flame. Sometimes a blue glass is used to filter out the yellow of sodium.\nThe test cannot differentiate between all elements. Several metals produce the same flame colour. Some compounds do not change the colour of the flame at all.\n\nrelated:\n\natomic structures\nemission spectra\n"

As the solvent front moves up the gel, it dissolves the sample and carries it up the matrix with it.\nsome of the particles in the sample stick more strongly to the silica gel than others, so they lag behind the solvent.\neventually the different substances in the sample separate out, with similar molecules travelling a similar distance.\n\ncapillary action of TLC §\n\nthe solvent (i.e. the mobile phase) is drawn up the stationery phase by capillary action.\nadhesive forces are between molecules of different substances. adhesion enables solvent molecules to bond to the stationery phase.\ncohesive forces are between molecules o the same substance.

(SHE)\n\nIntermolecular Forces §\n\nDescribe the difference between intramolecular bonding and intermolecular forces.\n\nTwo bondings exist in a molecular substance.\nIntramolecular forces are the strongest of the two bonds.\n\nThese are the bonds that exists within molecules between atoms.\nessentially keeps the atoms clustered together within a molecule.\nthee covalent bonds are not affected during melting, boiling or evaporating.\n\nonly chemical changes affect these bonds.\n\n\n\n\nIntermolecular forces are much weaker.\n\noccur within molecules, bonding between molecules\nmuch easier to overcome when a molecular substance melts, boils, or evaporates.\nthree types of intermolecular forces.\n\ndispersion\n\noccur in all molecular materials\nhowever, it is the only intermolecular forces of attraction present in non-polar substances like hydrocarbons and gases like N2, O2, and CO2\ngenerally increases in strength with number of electrons.\n\nclearly seen in non-polar, alkane family of compounds\n\nboiling point increases with increasing molar mass.\n\nbecause of this property, it is often stated that dispersion forces increase with molar mass / molecular size\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndispersion forces are stronger in molecules with shapes allowing maximum surface contact between molecules, ie linear in preference to branched or spherical shapes.\n\nthus linear molecules will have stronger dispersion forces and hence higher melting points and boiling points than spherical or branched shapes of similar mass.\n\n\ndispersion force arise when random motion of electrons produce short lived temporary dipoles.\n\nthis makes non-polar molecules temporarily polar.\ncause nearby molecules to form similar temporary dipoles called induced dipoles.\ntemporary dipole and induced dipole experience weak electrostatic known as dispersion forces.\nthese forces constantly change due to temporary and induced dipoles being constantly formed, rapidly disappearing and then reforming elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\ndipole-dipole\n\npolar (see notes on polarity) molecules attract one another due to weak electrostatic attraction between their dipoles.\ndipole dipole forces increase melting points and boiling points.\n\nbecause of this, substances with polar molecules have slightly higher melting and boiling points than other substances of similar molecular size.\n\n\ngenerally substances with dipole-dipole forces, ie polar ones, will be soluble in one another but not soluble in non-polar substances, ie ones that can’t interact by dipole-dipole forces.\n\nthis is why ethanol (polar) and water (polar) are soluble in one another, but mineral turpentine (non-polar) isn’t soluble in water.\n\n\nability to dissolve ionic solutes.\nthis property is due to attraction between the dipole of a polar molecule and an ion’s charge.\n\ncalled ion-dipole forces, not a type of intermolecular forces.\n\n\n\n\nhydrogen bond\n\ndirectional intermolecular forces. (? what does that mean)\nonly exists between molecules having Hydrogen-F/O/N arrangement of atoms.\ndue to electrostatic attraction between a lone pair of electrons (negative) of a F, O, or N atom and an H atom already covalently bonded to another F, O or N atom.\nsometimes described as extreme dipole-dipole attraction, where strong positive dipole of an H atom, ie one bonded to a highly electronegative F, O or N atom, is attracted to a strongly negatively dipole of another F, O or N atom.\ncan be part of the same molecule or from different molecules.\nmelting and boiling points are much higher for substances that can hydrogen bond than for those of similar molecular size that cannot hydrogen bond.\nsolubility is also affected - substances experiencing hydrogen bonding between molecules are extremely soluble in other substances which are also hydrogen bonded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare the relative strength of ionic, covalent and metallic bonding with intermolecular forces.\n\nintermolecular forces are relatively weaker than intramolecular forces (ionic, covalent, metallic)\n\n\nRecognise that intermolecular forces are present in all substances, but are most significant in discussion of the properties of covalent molecular substances, due to the lack of any stronger interactions between molecules.\n\nwhy is intermolecular forces present in all substances?\n\nbecause of dispersion force\nit arises when the random motion of electrons within a molecule produce short lived temporary dipoles (makes non-polar molecules temporarily polar)\npolar molecules cause nearby molecules to form similar temporary dipoles called induced dipoles\nthese dipoles create temporary and weak electrostatic attraction called dispersion.\nrapid state of change - constantly form, disappear and reform.\n\n\n\n\nDescribe how dispersion forces arise in all substances, and explain how molecular shape, and number of atoms affect the strength of dispersion forces.\n\ndispersion force arises in all substances because of random electron movements called temporary dipoles\nthe temporary dipoles create induced dipoles, and they form temporary intermolecular forces called dispersion force.\nmore electron and more surface contact has stronger dispersion forces.\n\nlinear &gt;

The film explores themes of isolation and violence. The story follows Kya, a girl who spends most of her life alone in the marsh due to rejection by society, who winds up being the primary suspect of a murder case. Kya’s “righteous” motive draws similarities to Owens’ personal experiences, in which the death of multiple animal poachers is allegedly the fault of Owens. Through the understanding of the film and its context I as the contemporary audience develop an empathetic but critical response to the actions of the murderer.\nBody Paragraph 1 §\n\ncharacterisation: the characterisation of Kya, a nature loving independent and isolated girl who will do anything to achieve her goals, including murder, parallels Delia Owens, a nature loving conservationist who would protect against poachers at any cost.\nboth characters are strong female heroines.\nthis developed my response of appreciation of their resolve to protect their peace and isolation at any cost, but im critical towards the fact they value the upkeep of nature to a human life, and their view that you can only have one, but not the other.\n\nBody Paragraph 2 §\n\nenvironment: the large marsh which sees more animals than humans is parallel to the environment of zambia which mark and delia owens lived.\nlike how delia adored africa, kya adored the marsh, both appreciating the solitude and isolation it provides, as well how the nature in it functions.\nthis constructs my response to understand that the environment can change the direction of a moral compass. people raised in normal society, who interacts with other humans values lives over anything else, but the marsh and african environment, in which perpetual life cycles of living and dying could be found anywhere and everywhere allows me to understand why kya and delia owens appreciate the company of animals, and do not put a higher value on human lives as others do.\n\nBody Paragraph 3 §\n\nvalues of murder: kya and delia owens, under the impact of environment and characterisation, both view murder as a “way of life”.\nkya doesn’t hesitate in murdering chase andrews, and manages to elaborately set up a plan and execute it to perfection, whilst delia owens allows and actively trains game scouts to take down and capture poachers with her husband and son mark and christopher owens.\n\nconclusion §\n\nR\n\nI as the audience develop an empathetic but critical response to the actions of Kya.\n\n\n\nI §\n\nP\n\nOwens effectively portrays Kya as a character to feel empathetic towards. It is significant for authors to allow the reader to believe in the protagonist, so the protagonist resonates with the reader. Owens effectively does this\n\n\n\n** treat Kya as a character in a story. Not as an actual person.\n******** focus on the how of Kya’s portrayal - is it through metalanguage, dialogue, narration what does the narrator use to assist him in portraying Kya?"

    "content": "1.     Discuss how your attitudes influence your response to the way a controversy is represented in at least one text.\nResponses are affected by the reader’s attitudes and how the text conveys certain ideas, such as if the text establishes context. This is underlined in the film “Where the Crawdads Sing” (2022) directed by Olivia Newman from screenplay by Lucy Alibar adapted from the novel of the same name. The film follows a coming-of-age story of an isolated girl named Kya, who is raised in the marsh and is suspected of the murder of a man she was once romantically involved with. My attitudes as the contemporary audience towards ideas of discrimination, isolation and relationships influence my response and positions me to be empathetic towards Kya in the representation of a murder case as the controversy.\nAs the contemporary attitude, my critical attitude towards discrimination influences my response to be condemning towards the accusation and the townspeople, believing they are motivated by prejudice and bias common in 1950s America rather than justice. The prejudice against Kya is highlighted with the townspeople always referring to Kya as “the marsh girl.” This label marks Kya as nothing other than her origins, something she cannot change. The label placed on Kya is similar to slurs against people based on their origin that is now shunned in contemporary society. The societal criticism of discrimination is much more different than 1950s America, where there are less consequences and seen as less serious. This labelling of Kya based on her origins, something she cannot change, influences my response to be empathetic towards Kya when she is accused of murder. [evidence 2, elaboration 2 goes here]. [link goes here]\nMy response to the representation of the controversy of the murder is influenced by my solemn (?) attitude towards isolation. Kya, ever since a young age has experienced isolation, not at her own fault, but the situation she was born in led eventually to her entire family one after the other abandoning the marsh, and consequentially, Kya (too long how to shorten). Kya reflects on this by stating that she “had a family once” who “called [her] Kya.” The use of past tense in “once” and “called” shows that Kya no longer has a family, nor does she have someone who calls by her real name, highlighting her loss of identity as Kya, and is now seen more as a “marsh girl” (should’ve used this for BP1 lmao). This is significant in influencing my response, as when she was revealed to be the murderer, my attitudes towards isolation influences my response to be empathetic, as the isolation she experienced and her exposure to the nature may present Kya a different viewpoint on life and death than everybody else, seeing it as an eventual constant rather than something to grieve over. [link and more bps here]\nFurthermore, my response to the murder case is influenced by my attitude towards relationships, in which I believe personal connection is an essential need contemporary context, in which social media and the growing connection with the technological word has led to a time where society is embedded more in social connection than any other time period of history. This is evidenced when Kya begged Tate to “please stay”, as she does not want to experience isolation again. In the contemporary context, where social media and every day the world gets more connected online, my attitude on social connection is that it is a basic human necessity and something everyone wishes to attain. This attitude further develops my empathy towards Kya in the trial, as she did not have the human connections relative to everybody else to learn what is socially acceptable and rather her environment of the marsh has shaped her character and perspective on life. When Tate doesn’t come back when he promised, Kya came to the realisation that “people don’t stay”, and she “had to do life alone” this shows although Kya wishes for social connection, those who are close to her consistently abandoned her eventually, to a point she feels she naturally undeserving of companionship (quote should go here). My attitude on the necessity of social connection furthers my empathetic response towards Kya. Hence, through my contemporary attitude on the necessity of social connection my response is empathetic towards Kya’s situation, because people she had connections with eventually abandoned her. (maybe unneeded last part)\nAs a contemporary reader, my attitudes on discrimination, isolation and social connection influences my response to be overall empathetic towards Kya. My critical attitude on discrimination, solemn attitude towards isolation, and the attitude on social connection, viewing it as a basic necessity everyone wishes to attain, all influences my response to be empathetic towards Kya. The portrayal of Kya as innocent and empathised towards the contemporary audience is significant in establishing that contextual information and backstory may change the perception and response by readers.\nGeneral observations\n-       Very very weak evidence, not enough ratio in terms of evidence to analysis. (what is the correct evidence analysis ratio?)\n-       Elaboration too complex and repetitive maybe.\n-       Needs link\n-       Expand body paragraphs 1,2\n-       Topic ideas are less overarching and seemingly develops as the essay develops rather than an umbrella concept (idk if this makes sense)\n-       Empathetic response is overused (used for all of them), maybe think of something else.\n-       Identifying main points in conclusion seems kind of weak\n-       Weak pointing of significance of tet\nExplain how at least one text conforms to generic conventions while still challenging its audience.\nFollowing conventions of genres is important, but to be distinct and create a piece of media that offers a new perspective, texts should subvert areas of genre to bring on new ideas. The 2022 film “Where the Crawdads Sing” directed by Olivia Newman from screenplay by Lucy Alibar based on 2018 novel of the same name my Delia Owens challenges and subverts the detective fiction genre and ideas surrounding it. The film follows the coming-of-age story of a girl raised in the marsh called Kya, who is suspected to be the murderer of someone who she was once romantically involved with. The text although conforming to certain ideas of the detective fiction genre, such as creating characters common within a detective fiction and following a common structure of a detective fiction, as more information is revealed to the audience as the story progresses, subverts and challenges the protagonist not being actively involved in solving the murder, and rejecting the traditional detective fiction ending to challenge or surprised the audience.\n“Where the Crawdads Sing” conforms to the detective fiction genre through generic conventions of characterisation but subverts and challenges the audience by making the protagonist not involved with solving the murder, but the suspect. The victim of the story is Chase Andrews, and the film conforms to the detective fiction genre by describing the details and specificity of his death, whilst also providing information on Chase Andrews, such as describing him as “the star quarterback of town” through an alternative timeline of the past which the film switches between. The characterisation of the victim and providing details similar to other detective fiction allows the contemporary audience a chance to figure out the mystery using provided clues to race against detectives and police officers in the novel. However, the text challenges the detective fiction genre by characterising Kya as not a prodigy or wise detective, but a young girl who is suspected of the crime. This challenges the traditional detective fiction approach, in which the protagonist is often a young prodigy or old experienced eccentric detective. This challenges the audience expectations, as although giving a greater insight to what happened, the recollections of the past may be from an unreliable narrator, which subverts from the standard of how detective cases are presented for the audience to solve, in which detectives can make more unbiased judgements. Thus, through the text’s utilisation of characterisation, “Where the Crawdads Sing” conforms to the detective fiction’s characterisation of the victim by developing his backstory and details of death but subverts and challenges the contemporary audience by making the protagonist the suspect rather than the detective.\nFurthermore, the text utilises narrative conventions of plot to conform to the detective fiction genre through following a linear storyline in relation to time and reveals more information and clues as the story progresses, but challenges audiences and expectations by rejecting the traditional ending within detective fiction to surprise the audience. The film switches back and forth between two-time periods of before the murder occurred, from when Kya was a child, and the aftermath, in which Kya was held at trial. The film uses the past to provide contextual information and clues on the murder, whilst the trial shows the ongoing decision that the jury will come to. This format allows the audience to intake information as film progress and allow them to make an educated decision on what the cause of the death of Chase Andrews was, which conforms to the detective fiction genre which slowly displaces clues and information about the case before the detective comes to a final conclusion, finding the murderer, or in this case determining if the suspect is guilty or not. However, the text subverts expectations by not revealing the actual murder, but instead hints in the ending that Kya was the one who did it, with her leaving a letter of confession right before passing away. This is different from traditional detective fiction endings, in which justice is served to the criminal, and everyone gets a happy ending. This challenges the audience to feel outraged at the fact that the murderer wasn’t condemned, unlike other detective fiction tales. Hence, through the employment of narrative conventions of plot, the detective fiction generic convention of slowly revealing clues as the story progresses is conformed, but challenges the audience when Kya was revealed to be the murderer, and the audience discovers that justice was not served.\nIn conclusion, “Where the Crawdads Sing” directed by Olivia Newman from screenplay by Lucy Alibar based on 2018 novel of the same name by Delia Owens subverts and challenges the traditional ideas surrounding the detective fiction genre. While conforming to certain conventions of the genre, the film challenges the protagonist’s passive role in solving the murder and rejects the typical detective fiction ending to surprise and challenge the audience. By doing so, the film offers a unique perspective on justice and the criminal justice system. This text ultimately highlights the importance of challenging and subverting traditional ideas and genres to offer new and unique perspectives on familiar concepts.\nideas\n-       Human connection &amp; independence\no   “please stay”\n§  Kya begs of Tate to “please stay”, highlighting her inner yearning for human connection and companionship. The desire for emotional support and closeness is further emphasised by the desperation in her voice and the vulnerability in her body language.\no   “I don’t know if anyone really knows me”.\n§  Kya states that she doesn’t know “if anybody really knows [her]”. This expresses her isolation and feeling disconnected with everything around her and reveals Kya’s doubts on if there is anybody out there who understands her.\no   “I had to do life alone… people don’t stay”.\n§  Kya reflects on her experience of abandonment by stating that she “had to do life alone”, and people in her life “don’t stay”. This statement highlights Kya’s loneliness and her struggles to form lasting connections with others. Her innate realisation people don’t stay suggest a sense of despair, and that all her life she never had the chance to experience a lasting human connection.\n-       Prejudice\no   “They call you the marsh girl…where you been, marsh hen?… where’s your hat swamp rat?”\n§  Marsh girl, marsh hen, swamp rat\n§  Throughout the story, Kya is subjected to ridicule and ostracism because of her isolation and poverty, as evidenced when the townspeople use derogatory names such as “marsh girl”, “marsh hen”, and “swamp rat.” These epithets reduce Kya’s identity to a mere label and reinforces the idea that she is inferior to others, and does not deserve formal education, respect or dignity.\no   “I never hated them, they hated me.”\n§  Kya stating that she “never hated them”, but “they hated” her highlights that although she was ostracised and judged by the people of her community because of her isolation and poverty, she never harboured any hate towards them, but is instead the victim of prejudice, underscoring the ways discrimination can harm those who did nothing wrong.\no   “They’re not deciding anything about me. It’s them. They are judging themselves.”\n§  Kya reflects on the ostracization she received and determined that the prejudice against her isn’t “deciding anything about” her, but instead the townspeople are “judging themselves.” She recognises that that townspeople judgement and prejudice are saying more about themselves than they are about her. This characterisation shows Kya’s developed self-acceptance, in which Kya is able to find resilience in the face of adversity.\n-       Nature // The marsh\no   “It’s like having a friend your whole life but you never see their face”.\n§  Kya’s statement, “It’s like having a friend your whole life but you never see their face” highlights the power of nature and the deep connection that individuals can feel with their surroundings. Kya has grown up in the marsh, where she has developed a profound bond with the natural world around her. Her statement suggests that this connection is as deep and meaningful as a friendship, despite the fact that it does not involve human interaction.\no   “the only constant in nature is change”\n§  In Where the Crawdads Sing, the statement “the only constant in nature is change” reflects the idea that everything in the natural world is subject to transformation and evolution. This statement is particularly significant for Kya, who has grown up in the marsh and has developed a deep understanding of the natural world around her. Her experiences have taught her that the environment is constantly shifting and adapting, and that individuals must be willing to accept and adapt to these changes.\no   “the marsh knows all about death.”\n§  In Where the Crawdads Sing, the statement “the marsh knows all about death” reflects the idea that nature is intimately connected with the cycle of life and death. Kya has grown up in the marsh, and is disconnected from her community, so she has developed a deep understanding of the natural world around her. Her experiences have taught her that death is a natural and necessary part of life, and that the marsh is both a site of birth and of decay.\nExplore how at least one text reveals that the values and attitudes of an individual or group are shaped by their circumstances.\nStylistic choices -&gt; genre\nLanguage features -&gt; film conventions"
