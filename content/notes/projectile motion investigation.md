Introduction
- Flat ground, angle is always 45 degrees
Aim
- goal of experiment finds the optimal launch angle if the launcher is raised (i.e. sy increases)
Hypothesis
- as the height of the launcher (m) increases from 0, the optimal launch angle (that maximises the range) decreases from 45degrees towards 0degrees.
Variables
- Independent, Dependent, Controlled
Physics reasoning
