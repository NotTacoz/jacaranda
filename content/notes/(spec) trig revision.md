## finding equations for reciprocal trig graph
- understanding relationship between reciprocal trig graph and function
- sec = 1/cos(theta)
- ![[notes/images/Screen Shot 2023-09-20 at 1.43.00 pm.png]]
- finding value for $y=a\sec(b(x-c))+d$
	- d is the principle axis (mean line) y position
	- vertical distance/2 between two points, OR distance from principal axis is the ABSOLUTE (not always actual) value
	- period = 1/b x 2pi
		- b = 2pi/period
	- find c from distance and stuff yayayaya

## auxiliary angle stuff
- turn a sum of multiples into a single sine/cosine :D
