## gas pressure

- **pressure** is defined as force per unit area
- gas particles exert pressure when they collide with the walls of their containers
- the SI unit of pressure is the pascal
- there are several units of pressure
  - pascal, kilopascal, atmosphere

## temperature

- average kinetic energy is directly proportionate to the Kelvin temperature
  - convert degC to K
  - K = degC + 273

## standard temperature and pressure

- STP standard temp = 0deg C or 273 K (changes to 25deg in Redox, not consistent over all chemistry fields.)
- standard pressure = 1atm = 7600mm Hg = 760 torr = 101.3 kPa

## gas laws

- the four properties of gases (amount of moles, pressure, volume, temperature)

### boyle's law

- at **constant temperature**, the volume of the gas increases as the pressure increases. The volume of the gas decreases and the pressure increases.
- p1v1 = p2v2

### charles law

- at a **constant pressure**, the volume of a gas increases as the temperature of the gas increases and the volume decreases when the temperature decreases.
- $\frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}$
- increase average kinetic energy.

### gay-lussac's law

- pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature a **constant volume**
- $\frac{P_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{P_{2}}{T_{2}}$

## ideal gas equation - combining the gas laws together

- $PV=nRT$
- P = pressure (kPa)
- V = measured in litres.
- n = mole of gas (mol)
- R = gas constant (0.08314 if using litres, atm, mol and kelvin)
- T = temperature, must be in kelvin.

## avogadros law

- equal volume of gases at the same temperature and pressure contains equal number of molecules/1 mole of ANT gas takes up a volume of 22.71 L at STP.

## applying kinetic energy

- gases "diffuse" very quickly
  - diffuse mean: movement of particles from high concentration of area to low concentration of area.
  - gases are easily compressed due to large amount of space between particles
  - gases spread out to fill a container due to the negligible forces of attraction between particles.
  - gases exert pressure because the particles move rapidly and collide with the interior surfaces of the container.
  - gases have low densities due to large amount of space between particles.

### why increasing temperature increases the pressure of gas in a sealed vessel.

- increased average kinetic energy of gas particles.
- increase force of collisions on walls of the cotnainer.
- increased velocity/speed of particles.
- increases frequency of collisions with walls of container.

### -> rates of reaction

- rate of reaction increases as temperature increases.
  - if food is left in heat, it gets spoilt pretty quickly.
  - particles with kinetic energy higher than activation energy will have successful collisions.
  - force of collisions will be more significant with higher kinetic energy.

## molar volume

- stp fixed at convenient standard values, molar volume of a gas can be determined.
  - e.g. at stp, 1 mole of any gas occupies a volume of 22.71 litres, this is the molar volume.
  - n(CO2) = 5
  - volume occupied = no. moles x molar volume = 5 x 22.71 = 113.55 L
