## title: "CAP3"

everything wrong with the lucarelli textbook (pdf ):

- can't ctrl+f to search for words
- can't copy and paste areas of the textbook (since everything is an image)
- no chapters navigation (that exists in the proper form)
- no glossary
- chapter navigation is by page number
- chapters navigation doesn't bring you to the right page number - 136 brings you to pdf page 132, and lucarelli page 138
- no answer key to the questions

## practice paper feedback

- acidic, basic, and neutral solutions all share the property of conductivity.
- if the blue litmus did not change colour, it still could be neutral, rather than only basic.
- all acids react with carbonates (to produce colourless gas), if it doesn't, it is not an acid.
- if it does not react with red litmus, it is not basic.
- green on universal indicator is very close to neutral (if not already neutral)

## The Task

(copy and pasted, not entirely, from the original provided **instructions.pdf**)
Task 2: Science Inquiry Skills Validation - Reactions of Acids

- This task will be a validation to assess your understanding of the experimental aspects of the Acids and Bases topic, particularly the reactions of acids. You have already completed the relevant practical tasks in class (practical work based on STAWA Experiments 31 and 32).
- You should be prepared to answer questions that include **equations and observations for reactions of acids**, properties of strong and weak substances, and use of experimental observations to identify substances.
- You should complete Lucarelli Sets 29 & 30 and STAWA Sets 27 & 28 as part of your preparation, as well as questions from the experiments completed.

### Experiment 31: Acids reactions with some metal compounds.

- Investigate the effects of acids (HCl and vinegar) and on some oxides, hydroxides, carbonates and hydrogen carbonates commonly found.

Task 7: Extended Response Task - Aqueous Environment

- This task will be related to the topic of Potable Water, and will assess your understanding and application of relevant chemical principles.
- The details of the topic, areas for revision and preparation tasks are covered in full in theÂ **attached instruction document**, please make sure you read this carefully.

### Instruction Worksheet

Questions will include ideas from the Solubility and Acids & Bases sections of the program such as:

- Water treatment to maintain safety for humans and the environment
- Concentration of solutions, and conversion between different units of concentration
- Precipitation reactions as a method to separate dissolved substances
- Acidity of solutions, including pH calculations, and neutralisation reactions to maintain water quality
- Calculations of quantities of substance related to above concepts (not including limiting reagents) Please note that questions will be limited to ideas covered in your chemistry program but may link to ideas from any objectives covered so far in the course.

## Roadmap of studying

1. Read through (and make notes of) relevant Lucarelli chapters (16.9 - 16.12)
2. Read through (and make notes of) relevant Pearsons chapters (15.1)
3. Simplify ideas concisely and pick out relevant ones to build into an Anki flashcard deck.
4. Revise Deck.

## Lucarelli

### 16.9

- Water makes up 55%-78% of a person's body mass.
  - This varies with gender, age, and body weight.
- Water (in our body) plays a vital role as a solvent for metabolic processes. e.g.
  - transporting nutrients.
  - excretion of cellular waste from our body.
  - evaporation of water regulates body temperature.
- drinking water is not as near common as normal water, as most water is not suitable for drinking or cooking.
  - this is because it contains dissolve salts and compounds that may be toxic to our organs (or carcinogenic - cancer causing)
  - freshwater may not be potable in some cases, as they could contain suspended matter like clay particles or microorganisms (pathogens), that can cause disease.
- chemical principles & methods of analysis is essential in designing and maintaining water treatment facilities, for the production of **potable water**.
- **potable water**
  - name for water safe to drink and cook with.
  - clear, colourless, odourless, contains no pathogens or toxic substances and be pleasant to taste.
  - **NHMRC** (national health and medical research council) provides guidelines for water quality management (in Australia).
- no limit for **TDS** (total dissolved solids), but NHMRC recommends to not exceed 600 mg/L
- water are treated differently depending on source.
- traditional source has been rivers and dam in WA. only requires disinfection + fluoridation.
- groundwater has become most significant, and more recently drinking water is sourced from the Indian ocean due to increased demand and changing rainfall patterns.
  - some stats (surely this isnt required right? KEKW)
