## enthalpy change
- $\Delta H$ = change in enthalpy
- $kJmol^{-1}$ 

## systems and surroundings
- done in year 10, but start from beginning anyways.
### reactant -> product
- reactants and products - consider when chemical reaction happens, reactants turn into products.
	- reactants -> products
	- reactants have enthalpy, and products has enthalpy.
	- when thinking of substance with bonds, the bonds in reactants are broken (requiring energy)
	- when products are made, new bonds form. (energy is given out)
	- overall enthalpy change requires how much energy required is to break bonds, and energy is given out, and the difference between the two.
### system & surroundings
- system transfers heat to and from surroundings - why? because stronger bonds form (products) - exothermic reactions
>[!note] energy cannot be created or destroyed
- enthalpy profile diagram
	- Ea = Minimum amount of energy required for reaction to occur. :]
