LiOH - base

**base**: 
**Arrhenius:** 
**salt**: salt is a substance formed when hydrogen from acid is substituted by metal ion. 

## Arrhenius Model
- [x] 109. Use the Arrhenius model to define and describe acids and bases in aqueous solution.
### Capabilities of Arrhenius Model
Arrhenius (Swedish Chemist) described a theory of acid-base behaviour centred on the ability of certain substances that contain H or OH to produce hydrogen ions, $H^{+}$ (aq) or hydroxide ions, $OH^-$ (aq) when dissolved in water. His theory states that:
- an **acid** is a substance that will **ionise** in solution producing $H^+$ (aq) ions
	- eg $$HNO_{3}(aq)\to H^+(aq)+NO_{3}^-(aq)\dots\dots$$
- a **base** is a substance that will **dissociate** in solution producing $OH^-$ (aq) ions
	- eg $$NaOH(s)\to OH^-(aq)+Na^+(aq)\dots\dots$$
- the theory gives a good account of the acid-base behaviour of many acids and ionic hydroxides.
### Weaknesses of Arrhenius Model
- to able to explain or predict the acid-base behaviour of many other compounds:
	- for example, why salts like sodium carbonate and potassium phosphate (which do not contain OH) are basic in nature and not neutral.
	- the Brønsted–Lowry model is more comprehensive and gives a broader and more satisfactory account of acid-base behaviour

## Comparing 0.1 mol/L HCl and 1.0 mol/L CH3COOH
- CH3COOH has a larger concentration
- HCl is a stronger acid because it **disassociates fully**
- HCl has more electrolytes so it is more conductive than CH3COOH

## Reactions of Acids
- metal (s) + acid (aq) -> salt (check w/ solubility table) + hydrogen gas (g)
- metal oxide (s) + acid (aq) -> salt (check w/ solubility table) + water (l)
- metal hydroxide (check) + acid (aq) -> salt (check) + water (l)
- metal carbonate (check) + acid (aq) -> salt (check) + water (l) + carbon dioxie (g)
- metal hydrogen carbonate (check/trust observation/read q) + acid (aq) -> salt (check) + water (l) + carbon dioxide (g)
	- Ca(HCO3)2 (aq) +2HCl (aq) -> CaCl2 (aq) + 2H2O (l) + 2CO2 (g)

## Ionic Reactions
- in most areas of chemistry, we write ionic reactions, not molecular reactions (even if it is not asked)
- for acids and bases, write and determine what type of acid and bases you are dealing with.
	- eg $NaOH (aq)+HCl(aq)\to NaCl(aq)+H_{2}O(l)$
	- strong + strong
	- $Na^+(aq)+OH^-(aq)+H^+(aq)+Cl^-(aq)\to Na^+(aq)+Cl^-(aq)+H_{2}O (l)$
	- remove spectator ions:
	- $OH^-(aq)+H^+(aq)\to H_{2}O(l)$
	- if it is a weak acid, then in solution it is present as the same thing.
		- eg CH3COOH -> CH3COOH because it is a weak acid (from molecular to ionic)
