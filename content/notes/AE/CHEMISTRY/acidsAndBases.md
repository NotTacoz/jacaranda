MgSO4 - salt
KMnO4 - salt
CH3COOH - acid
Cu(OH)2 - base
HNO3 - acid
LiOH - base

**base**: 
**Arrhenius:** 
**salt**: salt is a substance formed when hydrogen from acid is substituted by metal ion. 

## Arrhenius Model
- [x] 109. Use the Arrhenius model to define and describe acids and bases in aqueous solution.
### Capabilities of Arrhenius Model
Arrhenius (Swedish Chemist) described a theory of acid-base behaviour centred on the ability of certain substances that contain H or OH to produce hydrogen ions, $H^{+}$ (aq) or hydroxide ions, $OH^-$ (aq) when dissolved in water. His theory states that:
- an **acid** is a substance that will **ionise** in solution producing $H^+$ (aq) ions
	- eg $$HNO_{3}(aq)\to H^+(aq)+NO_{3}^-(aq)\dots\dots$$
- a **base** is a substance that will **dissociate** in solution producing $OH^-$ (aq) ions
	- eg $$NaOH(s)\to OH^-(aq)+Na^+(aq)\dots\dots$$
- the theory gives a good account of the acid-base behaviour of many acids and ionic hydroxides.
### Weaknesses of Arrhenius Model
- to able to explain or predict the acid-base behaviour of many other compounds:
	- for example, why salts like sodium carbonate and potassium phosphate (which do not contain OH) are basic in nature and not neutral.
	- the Brønsted–Lowry model is more comprehensive and gives a broader and more satisfactory account of acid-base behaviour

## Comparing 0.1 mol/L HCl and 1.0 mol/L CH3COOH
- CH3COOH has a larger concentration
- HCl is a stronger acid because it **disassociates fully**
- HCl has more electrolytes so it is more conductive than CH3COOH
