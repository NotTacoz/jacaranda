ACTION 1 (verb stem) | ながら | ACTION 2

- simultaneous actions that **ONE** person is doing.
	- ie you cannot use ~ながら for "while person A does this, person B does this" IT DOES NOT WORK
- ながら is usually added on the less important verb.
	- eg While I study I listen to music vs I study while I listen to music
		- music in this context is more important, as the sentence is about what I do while studying.
		- so it translates to 勉強しながら、おんがくを聞きます。
