- train buckling
	- reference kinetic theory explain why tracks come to be buckled, and offer a simple practical solution to the problem.
	- vibrate more vigorously, pushing each other apart causing thermal expansion.
	- since railing is limited linearly, the rails will expand in a linear direction pushing against each other.
	- solution is to have gaps between the rails to allow for thermal expansion.
- measurement error is not a source of error.
- writing evaluation/conclusion on accuracy:
	- calculating error and using it to comment on accuracy.
	- compare the two values, and state the metal is identified as titanium.
