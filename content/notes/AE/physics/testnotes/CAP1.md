## linear motion
### science as a human endeavour
- [ ] understand how safety and other road users has been increased through applications of newton's laws and conservation of momentum through helmets, seatbelts, crumple zones, airbags, safety barriers.
- this is a brief summary, and is missing a lot of detail to achieve a high mark. please revisit later.
- seatbelt designed to lock during severe deceleration.
	- as the human has the same motion applied as the car they are moving in, 
	- according to newtons first law, objections in motion stay in motion: when the car stops the human keeps moving forward, and is likely to collide or be flung out.
- airbag minimises injuries
	- if vehicle impacts object at 18-20 km/h or more, airbags inflate.
	- since the body will continue to be in motion, the airbags will help decelerate the body.
- crumple zones + helmets
	- similar principles to airbags
	- helmets have like a crushable foam.
	- crumple zones extend the time for a crash to take place
- traffic safety barriers doesn't entirely slow deceleration, but is good because it can enact an opposing force on the object, and protects people from places such as bridges.
