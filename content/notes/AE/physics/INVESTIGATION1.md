# hypothesis
- if the weight force of the hanging mass increase, the acceleration of the dynamics trolley increases.
# variables
- ## independent variable
	- the weight force of the hanging mass
- ## dependent variable
	- acceleration
- ## controlled variables
	- total mass
	- displacement (131cm)
# method
1. setup a cart on an elevated surface such the cart will travel 131cm before coming to a stop due to collision.
2. 
# results
