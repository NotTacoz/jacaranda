# hypothesis
- if the weight force of the hanging mass increase, the acceleration of the dynamics trolley increases.
# variables
- ## independent variable
	- the weight force of the hanging mass
- ## dependent variable(s)
	- **acceleration**
	- time
	- final velocity
- ## controlled variables
	- total mass
	- displacement (131cm)
	- initial velocity
# method
1. setup a cart on an elevated surface such the cart will travel 131cm before coming to a stop due to collision.
2. 
# results

# processing results
F=ma
a = m/F
