- **polar molecules** are those with **slight positive** $\delta^+$ and **slight negative** $\delta^-$ charged ends to the molecules.
- what are molecules like this called?
  - **net dipole**
  - what does **di** from **di**pole mean?
    - two
  - what does **pole** from di**pole** mean?
    - opposites.
- what occurs when molecule has several bond dipoles?
  - may reinforce one another or cancel each others effect
  - what does this depend on?
    - strength and direction of individual bond dipoles.
- how is polarity found?
  - drawing its shape and identifying all of its bond dipoles.
- what is required for dipoles to cancel each other's effect?
  - equal size and act in symmetrically opposing directions.
  - what is this called?
    - **zero net dipole**
  - what is this considered?
    - **non-dipole**
  - what is it called if this is not the case
    - **polar**
      - (non symmetrically arranged)
      - what does this produce
        - **net dipole**
