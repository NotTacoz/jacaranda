title: "flame test"
---

- A flame test is a visual way of demonstrating the different frequencies emitted when an electron emits photons and moves from a higher energy state to a lower energy state.
- # Procedure
1. Sample of the element/compound is introduced to a colourless, non-luminous flame.
	- In the experiment, we used ethanol, which was a coloured flame rather than a colourless one. This reduced the accuracy of the experiment and is therefore a systematic error.
2. As substance is heated, electrons become excited, as they gain energy the electrons can transition into a higher energy state.
3. Because the electrons are in a higher energy state, they are unstable. So they quickly transition back to their ground state, which emits photons with specific wavelengths (equal to the diff in energy levels)
4. Therefore, the photons have specific wavelengths, and the specific wavelengths mean specific colours are observed.
5. Since excited electrons can transition to their ground state in multiple stages, a set of diff photons of diff wavelengths can be emitted.
	- This means a spectra of different wavelengths of light is noticed.
6. This test is only valid for some metals, as most non-metals emit frequencies outside of visible spectrum, and cannot be identified.
- ## What can the test be used for
	- Ionic salts: simple ionic solids and metals can be used.
	- Because when heated, the metal ions and anions separate, producing emission within visible spectrum.
