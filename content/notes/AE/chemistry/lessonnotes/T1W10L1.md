title: "T1W10L1: hydrogen bonding"
---

a hydrogen bond is a strong dipole dipole attraction between an electron deficient hydrogen atom attached to an electronegative atom (N, O, or F), and the lone pair of electrons on a highly electronegative atom on a different molecule.

$^{\delta+}H-F^{\delta-}$
hydrogen is electron deficient.

hydrogen bonding is the strongest of all intermolecular forces and responsible for unique properties of water.
- boiling point (100deg)
- surface tension
- ice having lesser density than water
