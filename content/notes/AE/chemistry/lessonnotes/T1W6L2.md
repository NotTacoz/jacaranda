# patterns in the periodic table
- looked at subshells, orbitals.
- apply fundamental knowledge/situations to reactivity of elements and their physical properties.
- valence electrons: outermost electrons of the outermost shell. the electrons **engaged** in bonding.
- 2 properties of elements:
	- chemical properties.
		- element completely changing it's appearance when bonding with another element.
	- physical properties.
		- element doesn't change, it's physical appearance does.
		- $H2O (l) \rightleftharpoons H2O (s)$
- reactivity of group 1 metals increases as there are more valence electron shells.
- ionisation energy is the name of energy which changes the energy level of electrons.
- ## trends **down** the group:
	- the number of outer shell electrons is the same;
	- the number of complete electron shells increases by one.
```
The number of a group is the same as the number of eletrons in the outer shell of elements in that group, except for group 0.
```
- ## trends across the period
	- the number of outer shell electrons increases by one;
	- the number of complete electron shells stay the same.
	- the point at which a new period starts is the point at which electrons begin to fill a new shell
- # valency
	- valency is the combining power of an atom and is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms it could combine with or displace from a compound. (hydrogen has a valency of 1)
- valency is **NOT** the same as the number of valence electrons. E.g. Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons but it's valency is 3.
