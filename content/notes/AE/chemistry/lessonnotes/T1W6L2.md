# patterns in the periodic table
- looked at subshells, orbitals.
- apply fundamental knowledge/situations to reactivity of elements and their physical properties.
- valence electrons: outermost electrons of the outermost shell. the electrons **engaged** in bonding.
- 2 properties of elements:
	- chemical properties.
		- element completely changing it's appearance when bonding with another element.
	- physical properties.
		- element doesn't change, it's physical appearance does.
		- $H2O (l) \rightleftharpoons H2O (s)$
