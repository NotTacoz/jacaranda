- when particle so small, properties of particles change at different surface area to bonding (?) ratio.
- gold is red on nanoscale ?!!! (wowzers)
## nanoparticles
- the size of nanomaterials compared with diff objects
	- very very small (around 10-100 nanometres)
## nano-materials
- catalysts are nano-materials !!
- the reactivity of catalysts depends on the surface area.
- we don't know long term effect of nano-materials (uh oh)
