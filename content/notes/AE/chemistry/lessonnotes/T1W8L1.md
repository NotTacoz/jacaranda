- salts.
- some salts are different from others?!
## salts
- what is a salt
- salts are substances that form when a hydrogen acid gets replaced with a metal ion.
### copper sulphate (example)
- copper sulphate has two forms:
	- hydrated, and anhydrous
- CuSO4 . 7H2O (s)
	- hydrated salt, water is part of the crystal.
		- the water xH2O is called water of crystallisation
		- the water has weak attractions in particular to cations.
	- not ionic bonding, heat is enough to dehydrate the compound.
		- if that occurs, white powder of CuSO4 (s) and xH2O (g) which evaporates.
		- this is called anhydrous.
	- you can calculate mass of water compounds given mass of solution and mass of anhydrous salt. $$m_1 - m_{2} = m_{3}$$
	- use $n=\frac{m}{M}$ since u should use moles as the unit in your calculation.
### example question
1. from the experiment results below, work out the formula of the hydrated salt.
	- mass of CaCl2 . xH2O = 6.573g
	- mass of CaCl2 = 3.333g
	- n = m/M
	- n(CaCl2) = 3.333g / (40.08 + 35.45 + 35.45)
	- => 3.333/(40.08 + 35.45 + 34.45) = 0.03003 moles (0.03003243828)
	- n(CaCl2.xH2O) = (6.573)/(16 + 16 + 1.008 + 40.08 + 35.45 + 35.45) = 0.04565 moles (0.04564963747)
	- n(xH2O) = (6.573-3.333)/(16 + 1.008 + 1.008) = 0.17984
	- 0.3003/0.3003 = 1 | 0.17984/0.03003 = 5.989 ~= 6

## covalent bonding
- Cl2 H2O, HCl, CH3COOH, Co2, N2, O3
	- the following are all covalently bonded
	- shared electrons (called the bonding/shared pair)
	- long definition: there is electrostatic forces of attraction between the bonding pair/shared pair of electrons and nuclei of atoms at each side.
	- short definition: shared electrons between electrostatic forces of attractions.
### combining power
- the amount of hydrogen atoms required to complete the electron shell to achieve the stability of nearest noble gas.
