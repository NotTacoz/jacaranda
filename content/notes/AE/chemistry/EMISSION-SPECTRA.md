# experiment 8: flame test
## weaknesses of flame test
-   The test cannot detect low concentrations of most [ions](notes/AE/chemistry/DEFINITIONS.md).
-   The brightness of the signal varies from one sample to another. For example, the yellow emission from sodium is much brighter than the red emission from the same amount of lithium.
-   Impurities or contaminants affect the test results. [Sodium](https://www.thoughtco.com/sodium-element-facts-606471), in particular, is present in most compounds and will color the flame. Sometimes a blue glass is used to filter out the yellow of sodium.
-   The test cannot differentiate between all elements. Several metals produce the same flame color. Some compounds do not change the color of the flame at all.
# experiment 9: emission spectra
- spectroscopy works on the principle that substances absorb energy and emit energy as EMR (electromagnetic radiation).
- the radiation is absorbed or emitted in bundles (protons). what is a bundle lmao
	- radiation frequency wavelength corresponds to colours, and is specific to the atoms that make up the substance.
- when an element is heated the electrons in their ground state absorb energy and move to higher energy levels.
- when they return to lower energy levels, energy is emitted as light.
	- light can be seen as distinct colours.
