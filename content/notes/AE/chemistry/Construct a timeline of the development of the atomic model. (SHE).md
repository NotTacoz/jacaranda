- John Dalton:
	- Atomic theory of matter
		- 1. Elements are composed of extremely small, indivisible particles called atoms.
		- 2. All Atoms of given element are identical having same size, mass and chemical properties. Atoms of different elements have different size, mass and chemical properties.
		- 3. Atoms are not created or destroyed during chemical reaction.
		- 4. A chemical reaction involves only separation, combination. Or rearrangement of atoms.
		- 5. Compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine in a specific ratio.
	- TLDR John Dalton proposed everything is made up of extremely small particles called atoms.
	- why bad:
- JJ Thomson
		- discovered the electron
