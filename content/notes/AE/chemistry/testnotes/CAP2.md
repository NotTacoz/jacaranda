## Topic 2: BONDING, INTERMOLECULAR FORCES, AND PROPERTIES
### Introduction to Bonding 
40. Describe the valency of an atom as a measure of the atom’s bonding capacity, and use the periodic table to establish the valency of an atom for periods 1 to 3. 
	- 
41. Explain how the ability of atoms to form chemical bonds is related to its electronic structure, particularly the stability of the valence shell. 
42. Explain how electrostatic attraction between oppositely charges species / regions leads to chemical bonds. 
43. Use the periodic table to establish the type of bonding present in elements and compounds. 
44. Explain why the type of bonding present in a substance defines the physical properties of that substance, including melting and boiling points, conductivity of heat and electricity, and hardness. 
### Ionic Bonding 
45. Define ions as atoms or groups of atoms that are electrically charged due to loss or gain of electrons. 
	- ion is an atom or a group of atoms that has are electrically charged.
		- this is due to a loss or gain of electrons.
	- atoms/groups of atoms which have lost an electron is called a cation (positively charged ion)
	- atoms/groups of atoms which have gained an electron is called an anion (negatively charged ion)
46. Describe and explain how ions are held together to form an ionic lattice. 
	- due to **strong electrostatic attraction** between neighbouring **positive** and **negative** ions.
	- any given positive ion is attracted to all surrounding negative ions and vice versa.
		- there also exists repulsive forces, but they are much weaker as the **like** (same force) charged ions are further apart in the lattice (diagonally arranged) than the adjacent **unlike** charged ions. 
		- electrostatic force **reduce** considerable as the distance between ions **increases**.
47. Use understanding of ionic bonding to explain the physical properties of ionic compounds, including: 
	1. High melting and boiling points 
		- ionic bonds are strong electrostatic attractive forces between ions. These strong attractive forces extend throughout the ionic lattice keeping individual ions in fixed positions. 
		- Thus a high temperature, ie high particle kinetic energy, is needed to disrupt (melt) the ionic lattice.
	2. Hardness and brittleness 
		- if a large force is applied to the ionic lattice it will cause layers of ions to move.
		- when this happens, like charged ions will be forced to align alongside one another, ie no longer diagonally aligned.
		- this means **like** charges will be closer together than **unlike** charges. 
		- consequently **repulsive forces** will exceed **attractive forces** and the lattice will break apart rather than simply dent or bend.
	3. Conductivity in solid, liquid and aqueous states. 
		- solid - poor conductors
			- in an ionic solid the ions are tightly held in **fixed positions**. Thus they are **unable to move** and **carry charge**.
			- an **absence** of **mobile** charged particles means ionic solids are not-conductors of electricity.
		- molten (liquid) - good conductors
			- in molten phase, ions are mobile and free to move and carry charge throughout the ionic liquid.
			- since both positive and negative ions **carry charge**, positive ions move towards the negative electrode while negative ions move towards the positive electrode.
		- aqueous - good conductors
			- individual ions from the ionic solid are mobile and free to move independently of one another.
			- their mobility and charge enable them to conduct an electric current through the ionic solution.
			- the current consists of positive ions moving toward the negative electrode and negative ions moving towards the positive electrode.
48. Calculate percentage composition of an ionic compound from the relative atomic masses of the constituent species. 
49. Define and describe the difference between anhydrous and hydrated salts, and explain the role of water of crystallisation. 
50. Calculate the formula of an ionic compound from empirical data, including the formula of a hydrated salt. 
51. Perform stoichiometric calculations in order to establish percentage composition and empirical formula of ionic compounds.
### Metallic Bonding 
52. Describe how metallic bonding holds metal atoms together, in a lattice of positively charged ions surrounded by delocalised electrons. 
53. Explain the physical properties of metals, including: a. malleability and ductility b. thermal and electrical conductivity c. generally high melting and boiling points. 
### Covalent Bonding 
55. Describe a covalent bond as a shared pair of electrons, resulting in electrostatic attraction between positive nuclei of the atoms and the shared electron pair. 
56. Draw Lewis structures for covalent molecules, showing both bonding pairs and lone pairs of electrons. 
57. Use the valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory along with Lewis structures to explain, predict and draw the shapes of molecules and polyatomic ions. 
58. Explain the physical properties of covalent molecular substances, including: a. low melting and boiling points b. non-conductivity c. softness and brittleness. 
59. Recognise some common covalent network substances, including diamond, graphite and silicon dioxide. 
60. Describe the range of allotropes of elemental carbon (diamond, graphite and fullerenes), and explain why they have significantly different physical and chemical properties. 
61. Explain the physical properties of covalent network substances, including: a. high melting and boiling points b. hardness and brittleness c. thermal conductivity d. electrical conductivity 
### Nanomaterials 
62. Describe what nanomaterials are. 
63. State and describe how the properties of nanomaterials may differ from the properties of the bulk material, and give examples. 
64. Identify uses of nanomaterials and suggest advantages and disadvantages to their use. 6
65. Describe the potential health risks associated with the use of nanoparticles. (SHE) 
66. Describe and explain examples of environmental concerns associated with the use of nanomaterials. (SHE)
67. Provide a balanced discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of nanomaterials. (SHE) 
### Intermolecular Forces 
67. Describe the difference between intramolecular bonding and intermolecular forces. 
	- 
68. Compare the relative strength of ionic, covalent and metallic bonding with intermolecular forces. 
69. Recognise that intermolecular forces are present in all substances, but are most significant in discussion of the properties of covalent molecular substances, due to the lack of any stronger interactions between molecules. 
70. Describe how dispersion forces arise in all substances, and explain how molecular shape, and number of atoms affect the strength of dispersion forces. 
71. Use knowledge of electronegativity to establish bond polarity. 
72. Use understanding of molecular shape, bond polarity and symmetry to establish and explain the polarity of molecules. 
73. Describe how dipole-dipole forces arise, and explain how the relative size of a molecular dipole affects the strength of dipole-dipole forces. 
74. Describe how hydrogen bonding arises, end explain why this special case of dipole-dipole bonding is so much stronger than other examples of dipole-dipole bonding. 
75. Draw diagrams to show how all types of intermolecular forces occur between neighbouring molecules. 
76. Compare the relative strength of the types of intermolecular forces. 
77. Use understanding of bond polarity, molecular shape and symmetry to establish the nature and strength of intermolecular forces present in a covalent molecular substance. 
78. Explain how the physical properties of covalent molecular substances depend on the strength of intermolecular forces, including: a. melting and boiling point b. vapour pressure c. solubility in water and organic solvents 
79. Use understanding of intermolecular forces to explain patterns or relationships in melting and boiling points of covalent molecular substances.
