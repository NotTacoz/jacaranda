## Assumed Knowledge (from methods)
- Angles in degrees in radians (and converting between units).
- Defining sin and cos using the unit circle.
- Graphs of y = sinx, y = cosx and y = tanx.
- The pythagorean identity.
- Symmetry properties of trig functions.
- Exact values of trig functions for integer multiples of $\frac{\pi}{2}$, $\frac{\pi}{4}$, and $\frac{\pi}{6}$ radians.

## Sketch the graph of the function
h: \[0, 2pi] -> $\mathbb{R}$, h(x) = $3\cos\left( 2x + \frac{\pi}{3} \right)+1$
dilations first, followed by translations, provided it is written in the factorised form.
