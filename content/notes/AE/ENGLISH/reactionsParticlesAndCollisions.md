## reactions, particles and collisions
- particles colliding with a certain amount of energy cause reactions.
- activation energy : minimum amount of energy needed for reactions.
- rate of reactions dependency:
	- **frequency** of collisions
	- **energy** with which particles collide
- if particles collide with less energy than activation energy, will not pull. particles will just bounce off each other **if energy lower than activation energy**
- rate of reaction factors
	- temperature
	- concentration of dissolved reactants
		- pressure of gaseous reactants
	- surface area of solid reactants
	- use of a catalyst
	- ❌ ~~more~~ ✅ higher frequency
- reactions not steady rate. start off certain speed, and get slower until they stop.
- concentration of reactants decreases during reaction progress.
	- reduces the frequency of collisions between particles and reaction slows down.
- the effect of increasing temperature on the rate of reaction:
	- increased average **kinetic energy** of particles
	- increased **velocity/speed** of particles
	- increased **frequency of collisions**
	- increased proportion of collisions with sufficient **kinetic energy to overcome activation energy**
	- increased frequency of **successful collisions; increased rate of reaction*
