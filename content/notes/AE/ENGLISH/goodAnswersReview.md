Question 2: Explain a perspective on growing up offered in Text 2

Text two offers the perspective that growing up is an experience of greater difficulty for the parent, who is disempowered by the fleeting nature of their role, than for the child who is empowered by the future experiences to come. The text's exposition features the event of a father and daughter waiting to cross a busy street, the narrator centralising on the way the father 'grip\[s]' his
daughter's hand. The intensity of the verb choice conveys the desperation of the father to protect his daughter and the text reveals the gesture gives the father the certainty that she is safe, communicating the father's desire to fulfill his role as a parent in emotionally and physically protecting his child. The text continues to delineate the future experiences of the daughter through the anaphora of she will. The high modality of the future tense verb connoting the powerlessness of any person who attempts to stop her future, including the father. 

The text further reveals in its portrayal of the daughter's future in which she is getting married that her father will have to do the one thing he never really wanted to do and let go of her hand', the inevitability in the verbial choice conveys a sense of grief on the father's part. The anecdotal tone constructing the daughter's hypothetical future experiences in the elongated sentence structure implies a sense of empowerment in the abundance of experiences she will undertake as a result of rowing up The contrast between the nostalgia of the father who in letting go' literally and figuratively sacrificing the power he has to protect his daughter and the empowerment of the daughter through the suggestion of inevitable and unique life experiences conveys the bittersweet perspective of the father which is the process of graving up is of greater difficulty for the parent than the child.
