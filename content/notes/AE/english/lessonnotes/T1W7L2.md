        2. All [supernatural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural "Supernatural") or [preternatural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preternatural "Preternatural") agencies are ruled out as a matter of course.
        3. Not more than one secret room or [passage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_passage "Secret passage") is allowable.
        4. No hitherto undiscovered poisons may be used, nor any appliance which will need a long scientific explanation at the end.

        7. The detective himself must not commit the crime.
        8. The detective is bound to declare any clues which he may discover.
        9. The "sidekick" of the detective, the Watson, must not conceal from the reader any thoughts which pass through his mind: his intelligence must be slightly, but very slightly, below that of the average reader.

      - supposedly created as a parody of lord peter wimsey
      - a man born in 1900 into a prominent british aristocratic family.
    - Agatha Christie and Ngaio Marsh are fundamentally focused on "how". Their characterisation is crude, a bundle of quirks and characteristic utterances - Poirot's "little grey cells" - while the actual writing is un- demanding. Once the puzzle has been solved, there is no point in looking at the book again.
    - Allingham novels stands a good deal for rereading.
      - dorothy sayers is similar, but she anti-semitic and a blantant racist lmao.
    - Allingham is fond of her hero, but not in love with him.
