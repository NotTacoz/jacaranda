**Question: Discuss how the writer of this article has positioned you to respond to an idea about social media?**

Through Text 2’s utilisation of statistics, quotes to create a sense of credibility, the article positions me as one of the teenagers who uses social media often to respond with alarm at the overwhelming influence social media has on teenagers, and the risk that this could pose.

The use of statistics adds credibility to the argument that the article is going to make and positions me to respond with shock, as I would have underestimated the number of teenagers using social media. The article uses quotes from multiple people to further this sense of credibility, starting with Dr Vivek Murthy who stated that there is no “evidence to conclude that social media is, in fact, sufficiently safe for our kids.” The Doctorate title establishes integrity within the quote, and grounds the statement in fields of academia, and him telling the audience that there is no “evidence”, and that social media could be not “safe for our kids” positions me to question the influence social media has, and the problems this could pose. At this point of the article, the problem has not been mentioned yet, so due to this choice of structure, I am left to guess why the influence of social media could be dangerous.

The article uses statistics and quotes to further establish credibility, and through this, the text positions me to and encourages me to take action in response to the idea that social media is dangerous with its influence. The text’s skilful interweaving of statistics and quotes to establish credibility is shown … . .
