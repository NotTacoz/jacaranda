Science Understanding Heating processes 
-  the kinetic particle model describes matter as consisting of particles in constant motion, except at absolute zero 
-  all substances have internal energy due to the motion and separation of their particles 
-  temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a system 
-  provided a substance does not change state, its temperature change is proportional to the amount of energy added to or removed from the substance; the constant of proportionality describes the heat capacity of the substance 
	- This includes applying the relationship 
	- $Q = mc\Delta T$
-  change of state involves separating particles which exert attractive forces on each other; latent heat is the energy required to be added to or removed from a system to change the state of the system This includes applying the relationship = Q m L 
-  two systems in contact transfer energy between particles so that eventually the systems reach the same temperature; that is, they are in thermal equilibrium. This may involve changes of state as well as changes in temperature 
-  a system with thermal energy has the capacity to do mechanical work [to apply a force over a distance]; when work is done, the internal energy of the system changes 
-  because energy is conserved, the change in internal energy of a system is equal to the energy added by heating, or removed by cooling, plus the work done on or by the system 
-  heat transfer occurs between and within systems by conduction, convection and/or radiation 
-  energy transfers and transformations in mechanical systems always result in some heat loss to the environment, so that the usable energy is reduced and the system cannot be 100 percent efficient This includes applying the relationship efficiency $\eta=\frac{energy.output}{energy.input}\times \frac{100}{1}$%
