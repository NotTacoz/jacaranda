## year 11 physics ionising radiation & nuclear reactions topic test, dosimetry & nuclear medicine E&A validation review | errors
### part 1
#### question 1
b) how does the completed equation demonstrate that this isotope would be suitable for instigating a chain reaction
~~because it can undergo nuclear fission~~ -1
more than one neutron is released as a result of the fission of the nuclide
c) 
calculator error, equation F.T was correct, somehow misread a 9 as an 8 :( -1
#### question 3
- revise nuclear reactor parts - moderator / control rods -2
- moderator
	- u235 absorbs neutrons more efficiently when their speed is slower
	- the purpose of a moderator is to slow down the speed of the neutrons released by fission reactions
#### question 5
- use nuclear atomic mass values to find atomic mass (????) -1
### part 2
#### question 2
- briefly explain how ionising radiation kills cancer cells.
