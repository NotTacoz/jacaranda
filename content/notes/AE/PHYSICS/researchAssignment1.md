- The use of radioisotopes in diagnostic imaging including gamma cameras and PET scans.
## The use of radioisotopes in therapeutic treatments.

## The main ways in which radioisotopes are produced for use in medicine.

## Proton therapy and Neutron therapy.

## Radiation Dosimetry including Absorbed dose and Dose Equivalent.
- the severity of radiation exposure depends on the amount of radiation energy that has been absorbed (E) and the mass of tissue involved (m).
- absorbed dose = energy absorbed by the tissue / mass of tissue
	- $AD=\frac{E}{m}$
	- measured in joules per kilogram ($Jkg^{-1}$) or grays (Gy).
- weakness of absorbed dose is that type of radiation is not accounted, which is instead accounted by **dose equivalent**
- dose equivalent is derived from a table of quality factors

| radiation          | quality factor |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| $\alpha$ particles | 20             |
| neutrons* (10 keV) | 10             |
| $\beta$ particles  | 1              |
| $\gamma$ rays      | 1              |
| X-rays             | 1              |

- the formula for dose equivalent is $$DE=AD\times QF$$
- variable names -> dose equivalent / absorbed dose / quality factor
