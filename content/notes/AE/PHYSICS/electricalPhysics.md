## electric charge
- electric charge is a property of matter
- some particles have a positive charge, some have negative, and some have a neutral (no) charge.
	- how do the forces between electric charges work?
		- like charges repel, opposite charges attracts.
		- size of the force will be equal but opposite.
			- extension of newtons 3rd law.
- measured in coulombs (C) and is given the symbol $q$
- charge cannot be created or destroyed, but can transfer from 1 location to another.
	- this can be done by applying friction.
	- e.g. comb rubbing through dry hair, this will create friction, and provides necessary work to transfer the electrons from one object to another.
	- when comb is removed, it will be negatively charged.
	- when hovered over a neutral piece of paper, electrons are pushed away from the paper and the protons are pulled to create an attractive force.
		- attraction force that exist is stronger than the repulsive force that exists.
- an insulator is a material that **does not** allow charges to move around it.
- conductor allows electric charge to accumulate on the surface of the object, and electric charge tends to exist on the surface of the object; like charges repel.

## behaviour of charged particles
- particles have property called charge
	- charge can be positive, negative or neutral.
	- usually charge is balanced out perfectly.
	- when significant numbers of these charged particles become separated or move relative to each other, it results in **electricity**.
- tiny particles are called atoms

| charge   | positive | negative |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| positive | repel    | attract  |
| negative | attract  | repel         |

### measuring charge
- in order to measure the actual amount of charge, a 'fundamental' unit would be the size of the charge on one electron/proton.
- coulomb (symbol C) unit of charge.
- +1 coulomb (1 C) is equivalent to $6.2\times 10^{18}$ protons.
- charge of single proton is $+1.6\times 10 ^ {-19}$
- charge of single electron is $-1.6 \times 10^{-19}$
- the letter q is used to represent the quantity of charge.

## Charge and Current: Problems Worksheet
1. Object X is known to have a net positive charge. Through experimentation the following was observed:
- Object X attracts object Y 
- Object Y repels object Z
a. Explain, using the our current understanding of the atom, how object X could have gained a positive net charge.
- by having more protons that electrons
b. Object X is placed near object Z. Would these two objects attract or repel each other?
- attract, because Object Y and Z have the same charge (since they repel each other), and object Y is attracted to object X (opposite charges), so object Z and X have opposing charges (attracting each other)
c. When object X is placed near object Y it loses its net positive charge. Suggest the most likely reason why this occurs.
- because the net positive charge is counteracted by an equally negative charge.

2. After moving around on carpet in socks, Jane reaches for a door knob and receives a static shock
a. Describe the physics behind the cause of a static shock.
- Jane has a net negative charge because her body collected electrons, and the electrons are released when she touches the door knob.
b. Explain how the conditions required for Jane to be shocked occurred.
- metals conduct electricity, and the electrons stored in your body by collecting the electrons on the carpet is conducted by the metal doorknob, and felt as a "static shock".
c. On the diagram above, draw the charge distribution of Jane's hand and the door knob just prior to the shock occurring (be careful with the ratio of positive and negative charges drawn).

3. During a Van der Graff demonstration the metal dome builds up a large positive charge. The teacher places a single aluminium pie plate on top of the dome. After a while the pie plate flies off. Explain the cause behind the pie plate flying off.

1. Rubbing a balloon against dry hair allows the balloon to temporarily stick to a wall. Explain, using the diagram to assist, why the balloon sticks.
2. The charge of several objects was recorded into a table. This table is shown below.

| object   | charge (C)             |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| object A | $1.6\times 10 ^{-19}$  |
| object B | $4.8 \times 10 ^{-19}$ |
| object C | $5.6 \times 10 ^{-19}$ |
| object D | $8.0\times 10 ^{-19}$                       |

Which object did not have its charge measured accurately? Justify your choice.

6. Calculate the current that flows through a copper wire when 20.0 mC of negative charge passes a point in the wire within $2.00Ã—10^{-4}$s.
7. How many electrons would flow through a wire over a 2.00 minute period if the current in the wire was a steady 30.0 mA?
8. The material in the diagram below has mobile charges that move from the left hand side to the right hand side of the material.![](notes/images/Screen%20Shot%202023-07-24%20at%2012.45.04%20pm.png)
a. Which direction is the current if these mobile charges are positive? b. Which direction is the current if these mobile charges are negative? c. If two of the mobile charges were positive and the other two were negative, explain whether or not a current is flowing in the material.
9. Write in the current flowing through the electrical wire indicated by the "?" in each diagram below.![](notes/images/Screen%20Shot%202023-07-24%20at%2012.45.30%20pm.png)
a. 1A
b. 5A

d. -5A
11. Explain why silver and copper conduct electricity while rubber and plastic insulate again the flow of electrical current.
	- the electrons in plastic and rubber are very tightly bound to their respective nuclei and cannot readily move from one atom to another. Non-metals do not conduct electricity very well and are known as insulators. Meanwhile silver and copper the outermost electrons are only very slightly attracted to their respective nuclei. As a consequence, metals are good conductors of electricity. In conductors, loosely held electrons can 'jump' from one atom to another and move freely throughout the material.
