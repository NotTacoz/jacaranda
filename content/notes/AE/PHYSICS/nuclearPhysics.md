## 4 Types of Nuclear Radiation
### Alpha Particles (Radiation)
- Made up of two protons and two neutrons.
- Represented as $^4_{2}He$
- Doesn't have any electrons, so overall charge of 2+.
- Relatively large, so it can't penetrate very far into other materials.
- Absorbed by a single sheet of paper.
- Strongly ionising - easily knocking out electrons it collides with.
### Beta Particles
- Charge of -1
- Basically no mass.
- Neutron decays into a proton and an electron, where the electron is emitted at high speed.
- Moderately ionising.
- Absorbed by aluminium.
### Gamma Rays
- Aren't particles at all.
- Waves of electromagnetic radiation.
- Moves at speed of light.
- No mass.
- Often emitted after alpha or beta radiation.
- Weakly ionising.
- High penetration requiring concrete/lead.
### Neutrons
- If too many neutrons occurs, causing it to become unstable, a neutron can be emitted to increase stability.

## Half Life
- Activity: overall rate of decay.
- Measured in becquerels, which is the decays per second (Bq)
- Half Life: time taken for a the number of radioactive nuclei in a sample to halve.
- $n=\frac{t}{t_{1/2}}$
	- t = the time where nuclear energy has occurred. 
	- n = the number of half lives elapsed. 
	- $t_{1/2}$ = half-life of the nuclei.
- $N=N_{0}\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n$
	- N = number of radioactive nuclei remaining.
	- $N_{0}$ = initial number of radioactive nuclei.
	- n = number of half lives elapsed.
