- when looking at identifying the explicit rule, it is finding the rule through linear equations and quadratic relationships like that
	- different when finding the recursive rule.
	- look and think about what the rule might be, 1 square 2 square 3 square etc.
	- contextual questions when dealing with time - be careful how n relates to the context!
	- be careful what n=, "in 5 years time, when n starts at 1", n = 6
		- however, "in the 5th year" n is 5
		- in the 5th year and in 5 years time is different depending on what n starts at!!!!!!!!!!!!!! be very very careful oOoOoOoOoo
## applications of exponentials
- can be modelled using general form$$A=A_{0}b^t$$ (not every exponential can be modelled with this however, there exists a more general formulae where there is something cooling down - to a diff temperature, and there is a clear tangent, but you cannot model this with the general formula, where you need some sort of + k)
- A is the final amount, A0 is the initial amount, b is growth/decay
- half life formula yay!!!!!! (physics reference)
