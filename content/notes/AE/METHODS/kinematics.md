## location
- location with reference to the fixed point $0$
## displacement & distance
### displacement
- displacement s is a **vector**
- $s = \Delta x = x_{2} -x_{1}1$
- positions are often given as displacements from the origin $0$
### distance
- distance is a **scalar**
- make sure you're clear between difference between displacement and distance (scalar vs vector, where distance doesn't have a direction)
- distance describes total length travelled by particle, whilst displacement is not.
## velocity and speed
### velocity
- velocity v is a **vector**, describing the **rate of change in position**
- average velocity over the time interval $[t_{1},t_{2}]$ is $$v_{av}=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}=\frac{x_{2}-x_{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}$$
- instantaneous velocity is given by: $$v=\frac{dx}{dy}=\frac{ds}{dt}$$
### speed
- average speed != average velocity
- average speed = distance / time
