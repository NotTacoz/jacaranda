## average rate of change

- straight line graphs have constant gradients.
- non linear functions have gradients that vary, and the gradient is often **estimated** from chords or secants.
  - **chord**: a line between two points on a curve.
  - **secant**: a line through two points on a curve.
- for any function f(x), the gradient of the chord or secant from points (a, f(a)) to (b, f(b)) is the average rate of change over the interval of [a, b].

### difference quotient

- h is the small change in x, corresponding to b-a or x2 - x1, hence x+h corresponds to b or x2 $$\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$

### lebiniz notation

- $\delta$ means "small change in or "increment in"$$\frac{\delta y}{\delta x}$$

#### example questions (done in class)

- f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 5
  - x at 1 = 1 - 2 + 5 = 4
  - x at 5 = 25 - 10 + 5 = 20
  - change of 16/4 = 4
- T = 600/(t^2+2t+30) where t is time after 6pm
  - temp @ 6pm: 600/30 = 20degC
  - temp @ midnight: 600/(36+12+30) = 7.7 deg C
  - rate of change: (20-7.7) / (6-12) = -2.05 deg C / hour

## instantaneous rate of change

- instantaneous rate of change occurs as there is smaller and smaller intervals to create a gradient.
- expressed as $rate_{inst}=\frac{\delta p}{\delta q}$ (i dont know if this is right)
