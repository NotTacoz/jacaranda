## basic cubic function

- the basic cubic function is $y=x^3$
  - key features of the functions is that
  - horizontal inflection point at the origin $(0,0)$
  - intercepts: both at $(0,0)$
  - end behaviour:
    - as $x\to \infty,y\to \infty$
    - as $x\to-\infty,y\to-\infty$

## features of f(x) = a(x-h)^3 + k

- to graph, transform y=x^3 as follows:

1. dilate by a factor of |a| from the x-axis - or along the y-axis
   | feature | value or location |
   | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
   | horizontal inflection point | (h,k) |
   | end behaviour | when a>0: as $x\to \infty,y\to \infty$ <br /> blah blah blah something else oops i didnt write it down in time check onennote|

- find x-intercepts, blah blah, sketch it.
