# quadratic equations
- many situations can be modelled using quadratic equation, so it is useful to be able to solve them.
	1. rearrange the equation into the form $ax^2 + bx + c =0$
		1. you may need to expand and simplify first.
	2. factorise the quadratic, using the techniques.
	3. use null factor theorem (if ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0) to solve for x

practice:
solve $2x^2 + 5x - 12 = 0$
- factors of $2 \times -12$ which make $5$ is $-3$ and $-8$
- $\frac{(2x-3)(2x+8)}{2}=0$
- $\frac{(2x-3)(x+4)\times2}{2}=0$
- $(2x-3)(x+4)=0$
OR
- $2x^2 - 3x + 8x-12=0$
- $x(2x-3)+4(2x-3)=0$
- $2x-3=0$ or $x+4=0$
- $x=\frac{3}{2},-4$

# quadratics in turning point form
- quadratics in turning point form $y = a(x-h)^2+k$ can be visualised as transformations of $y=x^2$ 
- [https://www.geogebra.org/m/EFbtkvVP](https://www.geogebra.org/m/EFbtkvVP)
- when a is positive:
	- parabola is **concave up**
	- the turning point is a **minimum**
- when a is negative, the parabola reflects about the x-axis
	- the parabola is **concave down**
	- the turning point is a **maximum**
- the parabola dilates from the x-axis by a factor of a
	- when $|a|\gt1$, the parabola is 'stretched' **vertically**.
	- when $|a|\lt1$, the parabola is squashed **vertically**.
	- the dilations are NOT horizontal !!
- $y=ax^2$ to $y=a(x-h)^2+k$
- the parabola
	- translates right $h$ units
		- left if $h$ is negative
	- translates up $k$ units
		- down if $k$ is negative
	- the turning point is at ($h$,$k$)
	- the axis of symmetry is at $x=h$
