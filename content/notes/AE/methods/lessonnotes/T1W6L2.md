# completing the square
i studied jap instead so ill do this later lol :(
future thomas here, did it later

# recap


$x^2 + 2nx = (2+x)^2 - n^2$
no longer have to explicitly create a perfect square.
the new process more simple and streamlined, but if you're still confused, you can use the old way.
solve $2x^2-3x-1=0$ by completing the square
