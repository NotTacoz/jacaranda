## the life of i the struggle to be real
- over time we have invented new numbers
- i isnt real tho :(

## what are imaginary numbers
start by defining $$i=\sqrt{ -1 }$$
allow multiplication by real numbers e.g. $$3 \times i = 3i \text{ or } -1.5 \times i = -1.5i$$
these are examples of new numbers!

these are called **imaginary numbers**, even though they aren't more or less real than other numbers.
a number $bi$ where $b$ is real is called 'imaginary'
## complex numbers
lets look at [[notes/AE/specialist/complex numbers|complex numbers]]
