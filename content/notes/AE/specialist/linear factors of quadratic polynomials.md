- you can find [[notes/AE/specialist/solutions of quadratic equations|solutions of quadratic equations]] using [[notes/AE/specialist/complex numbers|complex numbers]]
- e.g. factorise $x^2+2x+5$,
- solving $x^2+2x+5=0$ using QF gives
	- $-1\pm 2i$ (simplified)
- you can give it in the form $(x+p)(x+q)$ where $p$ and $q$ are the solutions to $x$
- $=(x+1-2i)(x+1+2i)$
