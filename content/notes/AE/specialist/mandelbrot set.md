## mandelbrot set
follows on the [[notes/AE/specialist/complex numbers|complex numbers]] topic
going rouge - not related to course concepts, but awe aspiring

## sequences !!?
- recursive formula for an arithmetic sequence
- T1 = 2
- Tn+1 = Tn+3
- for any number n, find the values in the sequence given by n^2 + n
	- some numbers approach infinity e.g. 1 - 1, 1, 2, 5, 26, 677, 458330, 2.11x10^11, 4.41x10^22,1.95x10^45, 3.79x10^90
	- some numbers such as 0.2 give sequences of number which will stay small forever
	- -1 oscillates back and forth!
- the process we just used can be defined as the following;
	- $T_{1}=n$
	- $T_{n+1}=T_{n}^2+T_{1}$
- which values of $T_{1}$ give a sequence whose $T_{n}$ values stay small forever? (and does not approach infinity)

- -2 - 0.25 is the rough range where numbers stay small forever following the sequence!

- plot the black numbers (smallest forever) in the [[notes/AE/specialist/argand diagrams|complex plane]], what shape would you get?
