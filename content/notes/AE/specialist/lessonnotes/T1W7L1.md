# vectors in euclidean geometry
if you have two points, you can make a vector that starts from point A, B 
$\overrightarrow{AB}$ represents the vector 'from A to B'
Note that $\overrightarrow{AB}$ has vector AB and magnitude $\overline{AB}$
in the case $ABCD$ is a parallelogram
- the lines $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{DC}$ are distinct and different line segments.
-  $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\overrightarrow{DC}$ are the same vector.
- think of vectors as properties of directed line segments.
	- if two segments have length 6, the same number 6 is used to describe their lengths.
	- likewise, the same vector is used to describe the magnitude and direction of two segments with the same magnitude and direction.
	- vectors don't have a fixed location (but the things they describe might)
