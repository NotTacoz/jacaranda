# difference between permutation and combination
 permutation is arrangement of things
- order matters in permutations
- $ABC$ and $BCA$ are different permutations of letters A,B,C
a combination is a collection of things
- order is irrelevant in combinations
- $ABC$ and $BCA$ are the same combination
- $ABC$ and $BCD$ are different combinations
permutation formula for A, B, C and D
- $4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 4!$
- the number of permutations of n objects is n!
for all integers $n \geq 1$ $$n\times(n-1)\times(n-2)\times\dots \times1$$ and $$0=1$$
# digression
recursive definition:
- for all integers $n \geq 1$ $$n!=n\times(n-1)!$$
- and $$0=1$$
- simplifying expressions involving factorials. given m! and n! where m < n, the highest common factor is m!
- evaluate that shit ![](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020230302120119.png)
# taken r at a time
list all permutations of a b c d and e taken 2 at a time
general formula is $\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$
