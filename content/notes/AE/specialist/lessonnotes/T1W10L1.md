god. this is awful. proofs, AND vectors? two of the worst portions of maths in existence. I am going to get a 20% in this test. ABSOLUTELY awful. geometrical proofs at that.

i love proofs. i love vectors. i love geometrical proofs. i love asa ass sas sss !!!!

## facts of vector algebra you can use:

- $a=b$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ have the same magnitude and direction
- $-a$ has the same magnitude as $a$ but the opposite direction6
- for a scalar $\lambda>0$, $\lambda a$ has magnitude $\lambda|a|$ and the same direction as $a$
- if $a=\lambda b$ then if $\lambda>0$, $a$ and $b$ are like parallel vectors; otherwise if $\lambda<0$, $a$ and $b$ are unlike parallel vectors.
- vectors can be added using a triangle of vectors
- $a-b=a+(-b)$
- if $\lambda$ is a scalar, then $\lambda(a+b)=\lambda a+\lambda b$
- $a\perp b$ if and only if $a\cdot b=0$
