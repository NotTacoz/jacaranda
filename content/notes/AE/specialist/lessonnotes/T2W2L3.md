## a
the angle between a tangent and a radius drawn at the point of contact is a right angle.
- a rough proof by contradiction:
	- a rough proof by contradicton:
		- assume line $\overline{AB}$ is tangent to the circle at C but $<\angle{OCB}<90\degree$
	- what is loss of generality?
		- without loss of generality, we assume $\angle{OCB}$ is acute
the angle between a tangent and chord equals the angle in the alternate segment
the two tangents drawn form a point to a circle are of equal length
