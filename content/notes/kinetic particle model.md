## pearson physics definition
- making assumptions about how kinetic particles work.
- assumes that:
	- all matter is made up of many very small particles (atoms or molecules)
	- the particles are in constant motion.
	- overall, no kinetic energy is lost/gained during elastic collisions between particles.
	- there exists forces of attraction and repulsion between particles in a material.
	- the distance particles in a gas are large compared with the size of the particles
- applies to all states (or phases) of matter.
