## Discuss how the resolution of a text you have studied encourages audiences to respond in a specific way
The resolution of <u>Beetlejuice</u> encourages audience to respond in acceptance towards developing family-like relationship with people who are characteristically and physically different.

<u>Beetlejuice</u> highlights the difference in the characterisation of the Maitlands and the Deetz family through Burton's employment of dialogue and ......... (how audience is encouraged in a specific way)
- The Maitland are isolationists, quiet townsfolk who enjoy spending time with only their loved ones, and not interested in social affairs.
-  Barbara Maitland's comment on Jane, a real estate agent, to <mark style="background: #FFFD00B0;">"leave [them] alone [at home]"</mark> demonstrates the Maitland's unwelcoming attitude towards outsiders like Jane.
- This juxtaposes with the Deetz family. When the Deetz settle into the house, they host a <mark style="background: #FFFD00B0;">"dinner party"</mark> <mark style="background: #FFFD00B0;">"for seven people."</mark>
- This is further emphasised with how both families view style. Both the Maitland and Deetz family have an obsession with style, but it differs from who they want to present.
- The Maitland express their style through decorating the house with wallpapers and Adam's model of the entire town.
- This contrasts with the Deetz family, in which Delia expresses that if <mark style="background: #FFFD00B0;">"you cover the wallpaper ... this place might be liveable."</mark> The connotation of liveable if the wallpaper is covered highlights the dissatisfaction and contrasting styles.
- The Deetz decorates and expresses their style for social status. Delia Deetz expresses her style through her sculptures. Her sculpts are not for herself, but to garner praise from people of high status in the art world, illustrated when she states <mark style="background: #FFFD00B0;">"My agent, Bernard, is bringing a woman who writes for Art in America.  "</mark>
- Whilst the Maitland's crafts and decorations are reserved for themselves, the Deetz likes to boast (?)
