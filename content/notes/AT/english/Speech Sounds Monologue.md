Rye calmly talks to the two children in monologue to herself as she turns from calm to frustrated.
"I miss mama" the boy said. 
Nodding in agreement, the girl whispered "We want her—not you."
"Your mama is in a better place. She can't be with us."
"Why can't she come back? She's right here."
"She can't. She's in a better place. A place you can't come back from."
"She left us all by ourselves?"
"She didn't. She wanted only the best for you."
"But she is in a better place—Why didn't she take us to the better place?"
"You are happier here." The words slipping through Rye's gritting teeth.
"I miss mama"
"She's dead." Rye snapped back.
"She is dead. I had a mama once, too. She's dead, too. My memories of her, dead too. Nothing stays, everything dies. In time, everything good will leave, and everything bad will leave. 

Point? There was never a point. "
