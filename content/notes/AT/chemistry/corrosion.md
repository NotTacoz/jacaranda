## corrosion
- corrosion is a redox reaction
## dry corrosion
- direct reaction with oxygen in air to form metal oxide is known as dry corrosion.
- sodium is very reactive, it must be stored under oil to prevent contact with oxygen and corrosion.
- $4Na_{\text{ (s)}} + O_{2 {\text{ (g)}}} \to 2Na_{2}O_{\text{ (s)}}$
- some dry corrosion, like with aluminium forms tough, impervious coating of aluminium oxide $Al_{2}O_{3}$, protecting metal from further contact with oxygen (this is called passivation).
	- iron on the other hand, is less reactive and when it does corrode, the coating it forms flakes, so it is unable to protect the iron underneath.
- things to note
	- **active corrosion:** porous oxide layers may form, and the corrosion will continue deep into metal.
	- sensitive to temperature: temp increases -> ROR increases
- 3 types
	- oxidative corrosion
	- liquid metal corrosion
	- corrosion by other gases
		- (so2, co2) gases react with exposed metal oxidising it.
			- remember hydrogen sulfide on silver
## wet corrosion
- electro-chemical
- 1) metal
- 2) gas
- liquid -> h2o
- Fe + O2 + H2O is common
- draw diagram lots of times to get it
- basic iron corrosion process
	- iron solid oxidises and h2o and o2 reduces to form iron hydroxide
		- this is not rust however, because this is not the colour of rust.
	- electrons are transferred through iron solid to second region where o2 is reduced in the presence of water to hydroxide ions
	- then forms fe(oh)3
		- further oxidised in the presence of o2 and h2o to produce iron(iii)hydroxide: red-brown precipitate
	- then forms fe2o3
		- flaky; porous rust, exposes iron underneath to further corrosion.
- rate of rust AFFECT
	- humidity => h2o in air UP => rate of rust UP
	- temp => rate of rust UP => freq of col UP, % of succ UP
	- prevention:
		- DOWN temp => prevents
		- in industry , materials corrode over time
			- DOWN temp in factory
			- contact process
			- SO2+O2 -><- SO3
## corrosion prevention
1 surface protection
- painting
	- preventing contact w/oxidants
	- drawbacks
		- paint fades/flakes away => x permanent
		- paint doesnt cover porous metal => incomplete

2 cathodic protection
- **voltage based** THINK OF THIS AS CATHODIC PROTECTION
	- definition: target metal (save): force it to become a cathode (site of reduction)
	- we force electrons into the site of reduction (attach negative side of battery)
	- the inert metal becomes anode
		- inert metal is submerged under usually water/soil (tons of metal ions) causing it to react
	- **forced our target metal: cathode therefore no oxd can occur = no corrosion**
	- drawbacks
		- expensive: constant electricity => permanent
		- maintenance: 
			- anode: change soil
				- anode soil needs to be changed because the ions gets depleted n stuff 9?
			- cathode: scratch (?)
		- CONTEXT BASED: electricity => wont work without
	- benefits
		- permanent
		- [[notes/AT/chemistry/green principles|green principles]] of chem
- utilising sacrificial anode (plating)
	- more R => metal reacts as an anode
		- preferentially/sacrificially oxidised
	- this forces our metal to be a cathode =D
	- drawbacks:
		- constantly renew: not permanent, more R metal has to be replaced
		- if target metal comes into contact with less R metal, then the target metal will be forced to oxidise. therefore, cant be used where metals/ions are present
	- benefits
		- cheap
		- whenever cathodic protection (voltage based) cannot be used
3 plating protection
- plate (coat)
	- inert: less reactive
		- less reactive coating
		- less R oxidises instead of target metal-> eventually forms oxide layer: forms protective layer
			- prevents contact between gas/o2
		- drawbacks (scratching problem)
			- why corrosion rate increases as scratches
				- oxidants can now contact Fe
				- fe will directly oxidise instead of cadmium: higher SOP (corrosion)
				- cd is in contact with o2, thus acting as a site of Red: cd increases surface area of the metal, e- released can flow through Fe and Cd
					- cause rate of ox increase, which increases rate of reaction.

	- galvanisation: more reactive
		- more R: higher SOP
		- this more R metal reacts instead of the metal you want.
		- this more reactive metal is called sacrificial anode.
		- galvanisation is **electroplating** of zinc onto target metal
		- coating target metal = more R metal. 
		- drawbacks
			- only protects metal less R than zinc
			- not permanent: coat it again
