## corrosion
- corrosion is a redox reaction
## dry corrosion
- direct reaction with oxygen in air to form metal oxide is known as dry corrosion.
- sodium is very reactive, it must be stored under oil to prevent contact with oxygen and corrosion.
- $4Na_{\text{ (s)}} + O_{2 {\text{ (g)}}} \to 2Na_{2}O_{\text{ (s)}}$
- some dry corrosion, like with aluminium forms tough, impervious coating of aluminium oxide $Al_{2}O_{3}$, protecting metal from further contact with oxygen (this is called passivation).
	- iron on the other hand, is less reactive and when it does corrode, the coating it forms flakes, so it is unable to protect the iron underneath.
- things to note
	- **active corrosion:** porous oxide layers may form, and the corrosion will continue deep into metal.
	- sensitive to temperature: temp increases -> ROR increases
- 3 types
	- oxidative corrosion
	- liquid metal corrosion
	- corrosion by other gases
		- (so2, co2) gases react with exposed metal oxidising it.
