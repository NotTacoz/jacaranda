## Reversible Reactions
- Definition: A reaction in which the reactants become products (through a FORWARD reaction) and products become reactants (through a REVERSE reaction)

>[!Note] All Reactions Are Reversible. This is a trick question often set by WACE markers, every reaction is reversible, but the probability (P(reversible)) is not always more than 0.

- A reaction is only non-reversible if activation energy is <u>too high</u>.
- System: made of reactants and products, and reversible reaction is when reactants are <u>constantly</u> forming products and products are <u>constantly</u> forming reactants.
	- Products - Reactants consistently interchange.
	- Sometimes disruptions occur - more products are formed, or less reactants are formed.
	- Imposed Changes: anything that disturbs dynamic equilibrium
## ANYTHING AFTER HERE HAS NOT TURNED INTO ANKI YET!!!!!!!!!
- forward reaction: Reactants -> Products (low Ea for exothermic compared to Ea of endothermic)
- ![[notes/images/Screenshot 2024-02-04 at 10.59.33 am.png|400]]
- Reverse Reaction -> Ae is high: lower rate as compared to forward.
- When a reaction starts, it is never equilibrium, it is net favoured, and F > R (5 vs 3)
- <u>Evolution</u>: Products increases: \[P] increases: freq of col -> ROR of R increases
	- Reactants decrease: \[R] decrease: freq of col dec -> ROR of F decreases
- dynamic equilibrium occurs when the forward rate of reaction equal our reverse rate of reaction.
- ![[notes/images/Screenshot 2024-02-04 at 11.04.32 am.png]]
- when the shit collides and touches that is when **dynamic equilibrium** occurs.
- a reaction is reversible if Ea(forward) and Ea(reversible) are low-moderate
> [!important] ALWAYS DRAW ENTHALPY DIAGRAM when explaining if something is reversible or not.

> [!Important] Always refer to activation energy for Forward AND Reverse.

## Open and Closed Systems
- Open
	- matter can be exchanged
	- e.g. beaker with no lid
- Closed
	- matter cannot be exchanged
	- e.g. beaker with lid and insulated (wace only cares about lid)
- energy can be exchanged in both!
- we assume every reactants will form products and all products form reactants, but if the system is **not closed**, then some reactants and products are lost to surroundings, as they escape.

## Concept of Dynamic Equilibrium
- **Dynamic Equilibrium** can only be established in **Closed System**.
	- If matter is exchanged, you will lose reactants and you will lose products over time.
	- Because otherwise lost P/R => no F/R reaction.
> [!Warning] hidden marks in chem vv
> Only occurs under two conditions (teachers are cancerous about this apparently)
	> - Only if the reaction system is closed.
	> - Only if the reaction can be seen as reversible. 

- **state of dynamic equilibrium is achieved** if the forward and reverse rate of reaction is the same
- characteristics
	- macroscopic properties (**temp**, colour, pressure\[gases], odour) are constant. (they will never change)
		- **temp:** assumed that no energy is being transferred. assumed its insulated, otherwise heat will flow in and out affecting dynamic eq.
- **dynamic:** looks (macroscopic) like nothing is changing: molecular level R <-> P
## DYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM GRAPHS
![[notes/images/Screenshot 2024-02-05 at 7.53.11 pm.png]]
- start
	- concentration: R  max P=0
	- rate: F = max R =0
	- obs => red
- evolve
	- conc: R DOWN (consumed) Prod UP (produced)
	- Rate: Forward down, Reverse Reaction Rate Increases
	- OBSERVATION: DO NOT SAY FADE, DO NOT SAY DISAPPEAR **ONLY SAY DISCOLOURISE**
- end: -> concentration: \[R] = \[P] CONCENTRATION IS SAME, BUT AMOUNT IS NOT THE SAME. If ratio is 1:1, \[R] = \[P]
	- 1:2 \[P] < \[R]
	- 2:1 \[P] > \[R]
	- reactant and product concentration will remain constant
	- rate: Forward = Reverse
	- obs: constant <u>pale red</u>
- REMEMBER KEY WORDS AHH!H!H!H SCALING HAPPENS CLASS TO CLASS
- On graph, concentration vs time.
	- change \[R] = 1/2 change \[P] if ratios exist STOIC RATIOS MATTER NOW.
- DE -> concentration dont change => never comment on ending concentration ONLY <u>change</u>
## Exceptions
- h2o liquid vapour evaporation -> gas liquid
	- rate \[evaporation] = <u>constant</u>
		- rate of evaporation depends on temperature
		- there is **no** reliance on concentration (only: surface area)
		- ROR evaporation: forward
	- vapour starts at 0
		- reaches forward
		- vapour pressure = volume is a determinant of vapour pressure
		- bunsen burner underneath it, increase temperature
			- what is happening
		- 2 differences
			- physical
			- forward or reverse reaction rate are never fixed in chemical equilibrium
- solution equilibrium
	- when you drop a solid into liquid, ![[notes/images/Screenshot 2024-02-05 at 8.19.39 pm.png|300]]
	- they will never let u graph it cos its impossible
	- dynamic equilibrium at the end!! even tho method is different.
	- unsaturated =>  can increase
	- super saturated: rate of dis is fixed
	- saturated: is fixed
	- the rate of dissolution and recrystallisation will eventually fall to 0
		- subdivision phase occurs for a while, but once it is completely dissolved, the rate of dissolution will drop to 0
- equilibrium constant
	- very important
	- ratio of concentration(reactant):concentration(product)
		- has to be 25 degrees
	- 25 degrees if ?????
	- at <u>equilibrium</u> \[A], B, C, D
	- H2 + I2 <-> 2Hi
	- Kc = \[HI]2/\[H2]\[I2]
	- p reaction is p^2
	- stoic chemistry ratios as powers
	- ![[notes/images/Screenshot 2024-02-05 at 8.24.06 pm.png|300]]
	- Kc = 1: concentration of products = conc of R at end. favours neither reactant or product (when reaction is done, there will be more of neither reactants/rpdocuts)
	- Kc > 1: conc products > conc reactants
	- Kc < 1 conc reactants > conc products
	- Kc determines acid strength =D
	- uses of kc:
		- acid base strenght
		- electrolyte strength
		- yield
	- kc only works/is applicable in aqueous and gaseous reactants
	- 2CaCO3 (s) + H2O (l) <-> Ca (s) + CO2 (g) + H2 (g)
	- Kc = conc(CO2)conc(H2)
	- does Kc ever change?
		- temperature is the only factor that changes Kc, thus Kc is a fixed value
	- if Kc = 10 = \[CO2]\[H2]
		- if Kc is a constant value, if you add more CO2, then all the extra will be converted to calcium carbonate.
		- VERY IMPORTANT
		- OCEAN ACID! 10 MARKS LOST!!
		- WHEN YOU ANALYSE EQUILIBRIUM, WRITE KC! otherwise youd get trolled
	- heterogeneous : s l q
	- homogenous : all solid, all liquid
		- if it is homogenous => include everything

## Concept of Partial Pressure
- Partial Pressure is the pressure of gas molecules if it occupies the system by itself.
- If temp increases, pressure increases
	- the partial pressure increases
- therefore if temp increases, partial pressure increases
- if temp increases, conc of aqueous products don't change

## Le Chatelier's Principle
- never refer to as LCP
- if an imposed changed disrupts equilibrium, we need to be able to describe how equilibrium will be readjusted, ???

>[!important] "According to Le Chatelier's Principle, the chemical system will re-establish equilibrium to partially counteract the imposed change."

- STATE WHICH DIRECTION EQ shifts and thus how the imposed change is partially counteracted.
### EASY HACK
1. step 1: identify change and make sure you can recognise it as an increase/decrease in some macroscopic property.
2. ![[notes/images/Screenshot 2024-02-06 at 4.10.01 pm.png]] REMEMBER THIS PUT THIS INTO ANKI =D 
- WE NEED TO DECREASE \[CR2O72-] AND TO DO THAT, WE NEED TO FAVOUR THE RIGHT 

>[!note] REMEMBER YOUR ENDOTHERMIC AND EXOTHERMIC GRAPHS AND REACTIONS!!

- Kc never changes except with temperature

## collision theory
- imposed change
- rate of forward partially dec and reverse inc
	- forward reaction 
- ![[notes/images/Pasted image 20240206171226.png]]
- solution goes to **NET INCREASE IN CRO72-** (TYPO IN ABOVE!!)
