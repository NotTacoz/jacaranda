		- RIGHT

		- REDUCED, OXIDISED
	- What is a disproportionation reaction?
		- Redox reaction where one species is oxidised and reduced
		- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">only molecules of a polyvalent (3+ valency) element undergo disproportionation</mark>
		- give example
2.     Apply oxidation numbers to identify the species being oxidised and reduced in a redox reaction.  %% fold %%

		- way of keeping track extent atom has gained/lost electrons
	- What does higher (more positive) oxidation number mean? (red/ox, e- lost/gained)

		- List 5 similarities
			- ![[notes/images/Screenshot 2024-02-10 at 10.01.58 pm.png]]
7.     Describe the key features of a galvanic cell using labelled diagrams.
	- <mark style="background: #FFFD00B0;">What is a galvanic cell? (3 Marks)</mark>
		- A type of electrochemical cell that transforms chemical potential energy into electrical energy (1)
		- <mark style="background: #FFFD00B0;">In a spontaneous redox reaction that produces a voltage (1) (potential difference that drives an electric current. (1))</mark>
	- What are the main features of a galvanic cell?
		- Electrodes (cathode, anode)
			- Provides pathway for the electrons to flow from the reductant in the oxidation half cell to the oxidant in the reduction half cell without direct contact
		- Salt Bridge
		- External Circuit
		- Two Half Cells (reduction, oxidation)
		- Voltmeter (optional)
		- Electrolyte Solution
		- What is the direction of electron flow in a Galvanic Cell
			- Anode to Cathode
		- Is Anode Positive/Negative
			- Negative
		- <mark style="background: #FFFD00B0;">Why are the two half cells and electrodes separated? (3)</mark>
			- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">If the reductant/oxidant came into physical contact, there would be an instant transfer of electrons and no electricity would be produced (1)</mark>
			- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Separating electrodes into 2 ½ cells allows for the reductant and oxidant to be separated and prevents them from coming into contact (1)</mark>
			- <mark style="background: #FFFD00B0;">Thus electrons are forces to flow through the external conductor and electricity is produced (1)</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Why is a salt bridge required in a galvanic cell?</mark>
			- As e- move from the anode to cathode, if there was no salt bridge: the anode would become positively charged (as its lost electrons) and the cathode would become negatively charged (as it has gained electrons) (1)
			- If this accumulation of charge is allowed, it opposes the motion of the electrons and thus overtime there is no further flow of electrons through the external circuit: i.e. the cell does not function (1)
			- The salt bridge is required as it allows for ions to move between the electrons in the two half cells (anions to anode and cations to cathode) and thus prevents an accumulation of charge: i.e. completes the circuit and allows normal function of the cell (1)
		- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Why does the EMF produced decrease as the galvanic cell discharges?(3 Marks)</mark>
			- As the cell discharged, the reactants are used up in the redox reaction and thus their concentration decreases (1)
			- As concentration decreases, the rate of the redox reaction decreases and so the rate of electron transfer through the external circuit decreases: i.e. current decreases (1)
			- As the voltage produced is proportional to the current, the voltage produced also decreases (1)
8.     Describe and explain the role of the following in the operation of a galvanic cell:
	- a.     <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Anode processes – using half equations</mark>
		- site of oxidation
	- b.     <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Cathode processes – using half equations</mark>
		- site of reduction
	- c.     <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Electrolyte</mark>
		- solution of free/mobile ions that can flow and conduct and electric current
			- It stores some reagents as well as allowing the flow of ions between the electrodes and the salt bridge: thus ensuring that there is no accumulation of charge and a complete electric circuit is formed
	- d.     <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Salt bridge and ion migration</mark>
		- a **non-reactive electrolyte solution** that links the oxidation and reduction half cell. For example **KNO3**
			- it provides a path through which ions flow between each ½ cell (anions to anode & cations to cathode) thus preventing an accumulation of charge and resulting in the completion of the circuit (1)
	- e.     <mark style="background: #FFFD00B0;">Electron flow in external circuit.</mark> 
		- a conductor that joins the 2 electrodes
			- provides a pathway for the electrons to flow from the reductant in the oxidation half cell to the oxidant in the reduction half cell without direct contact

	- what are SRP values measured at?
		- STP
			- 25degrees celsius
			- 100kpa
			- 1mol/L
		- what are limitations of SRP?
			- <mark style="background: #FFFD00B0;">can only be used at 25deg, 1mol/L conc and pressures of 100kPa</mark>
				- SRP ranking system: at altered conditions: rankings will change (i.e. reducing strength of species changes) making SRP useless
			- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">does not give information about rate of chemical reaction. </mark>
				- some reactions may be spontaneous according tot SRP, but may have larger activation energy: not occurring at "standard" conditions.
			- <mark style="background: #FFFD00B0;">only applied in aqueous solutions</mark>
				- a lot of reactions in liquid, gaseous or even solid states are not included.
11.  Use standard electrode potentials to calculate the electrical potential difference (Ecell) of an electrochemical cell. 
	- How do you calculate the Ecell of an electrochemical cell?

14.  Write half equations and balanced equations for redox reactions occurring in galvanic cells. 
	- How do you write half equations

		- make sure reaction at the anode is oxidising, reaction at cathode is reducing.
15.  Use standard reduction potentials to determine the relative strength of oxidising and reducing agents. 
	- what does higher SRP value mean (more positive)
		- more likely to reduce
		- contrary, higher SOP value means more likely to oxidise
16.  Compare the voltages generated by electrochemical cells constructed from different materials, using Ecell values.  
	- what does higher Ecell mean?
		- higher Ecell more voltage is generated, as Ecell = voltage

		- electrochemical protection
			- cathodic protection 
				- (ASSUME THEY MEAN VOLTAGE BASED. UNLESS STATED TO BE SACRIFICIAL ANODE)
				- process
					- applies an electric current on the target metal to force it to become a cathode (force it to reduce) by forcing electrons into the metal.
					- connected to inert metal, buried in the ground
						- lots of ions in the soil, causing it to react
				- +
					- permanent (as long as you force electrons into it)
					- green principles of chem (learn later)
				- -
					- expensive => constant electricity
					- maintenance => anode: change soil, cathode:

			- however, production of hydrogen gas could cause negative environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions.
		- lead-acid cell
