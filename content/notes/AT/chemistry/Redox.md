Consider checking out the [[notes/AT/chemistry/Edward ATAR 12 Redox Seminar Masterclass|Edward ATAR 12 Redox Seminar Masterclass]] for a shortened version of the entire Redox course.
## Redox Introduction
- **Red**uction & **Ox**idation
>[!Note] Read question carefully depending if it asks you to explain in reduction or oxidation.
- Reduction
	- gain of electrons
- Oxidation
	- loss of electrons.
- due to conservation of matter, reduction and oxidation is the exchange of electrons, and happens simultaneously.
- OILRIG
	- oxidation is loss, reduction is gain
- example:
	- oxidisation: $Na\to Na^++\overline{e}$  (oxidation half equation)
	- reduction: $Cl_{2}+2\overline{e}\to 2Cl^-$ (reduction half equation)
	- balance: $2Na\to 2Na^++ 2\overline{e}$
	- combine: $Cl_{2}+2Na\to 2NaCl+2\overline{e}$ (full redox equation)
	- Consider the oxidation number
		- Cl2: 0
		- 2Na: 0
		- 2NaCl: +1 -1
		- increase in oxidation number: oxidation
		- decrease in oxidation number: reduction
## Oxidation Numbers
- increase in oxidation number: oxidation
- decrease in oxidation number: reduction

>[!Important]
>
>Oxidation number (oxidation state): A number assigned to the atom to show how many electrons lost, gained or shared unequally (to form a bond). 
- Oxidation number of Na: 0
- Oxidation number of Cl2: 0
- Oxidation number of Na in NaCl: +1
- Oxidation number of Cl in NaCl: -1
- Oxidation number of H in HCl: +1
- Oxidation number of Cl in HCl: -1
- Oxidation number of H in H2O: +1
- Oxidation number of O in H2O: -2
- Oxidation number of F in F2O: -1
- Oxidation number of O in F2O: +2
	- because F is more electronegative than oxygen

| elements with fixed oxidation states in their compounds | oxidation state |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| hydrogen (except in metal hydrides - metal combined with hydrogen & fluorine)                     | +1 (-1)         |
| oxygen (except in peroxides)                            | -2 (-1)         |
| group I elements                                        | +1              |
| group II elements                                       | +2              |
| aluminium                                               | +3              |
| halide                                                  | -1                |

- for uncombined elements, the oxidation state is zero
- for atoms in elements (when element combined to itself), the oxidation state is zero.
- for simple ions, the oxidation state is the charge of the ion.
	- e.g. $Na^+Cl^-$ +1 and -1
- electronegativity: ability to attract bonding pair of electrons hence something peroxide (???)
- halides: ions of halogens

| halogens | halides |
| -------- | ------- |
| $F_{2}$  | $F^-$   |
| $Cl_{2}$ | $Cl^-$  |
| $Br_{2}$ | $Br^-$  |
| $I_{2}$  | $I^-$        |

- if theres one other electron added to it it is not a halide!

>[!warning] by convention put oxidation number **under** element, and the total **above** element. this is a common mistake !!

>[!warning] 
>BE SPECIFIC AND BE PARTICULAR. DO NOT BE VAGUE. EXPLAIN WELL AND LOGICALLY. E.G. "IT" NO GOOD 🙅

- in oxidation, the thing being oxidised is called the reducing agent!
	- vice versa
	- H2O something something idk
	- decrease in oxidation number: reducing: oxidation agent!
		- An oxidising agent accepts electrons and is itself reduced.
	- increase in oxidation number: oxidising: reducing agent!
		- A reducing agent donates electrons and is itself oxidised.

## Writing Balanced Equations
### Practice
Copper (I) Oxide
- Cu2O
Manganese (IV) Oxide
- MnO2
Iron (III) Sulphate
- Fe2(SO4)3
### New Types of Acids:
- Chloric (I) acid
	- Cl is +1 because O is more electronegative :)
	- $HClO$
- Chloric (V) acid
	- $HClO_{3}$

### Combining Half Equations
- Combine it to write balanced equations!
- Reactants go together with reactants products go together with reactants.
- cancel everything out.

## Balancing Redox Equations in Acidic Conditions
0. Assign Oxidation Numbers
1. Write the skeletons of the oxidation and reduction half-equations.
2. Balance all elements other than H and O
3. Balance the oxygen atoms by adding H2O (where needed)
4. Balance the hydrogen atoms by adding H+ ions (where needed)
5. Balance the charge by adding electrons, e-
6. If the number of electrons lost in the oxidation half-reaction is not equal to the number of electrons gained in the reduction half-reaction, multiply one or both of the half-reactions by a number that will make the number of electrons gained equal to the number of electrons lost.
7. Add the 2 half-reactions as if they were mathematical equations. The electrons will always cancel If the same formulas are found on opposite sides of the half-reactions, you can cancel them. If the same formulas are founded on the same side of both half-reactions, combine them.
8. Check to make sure the atoms and the charges balance.

## disproportionation
- 1 substance is simultaneously oxidised and reduced
- has the general equation: $$A+A\to B+C$$
## displacement reaction of halogens
- describing appearance of halogens
- ms pilling demonstration

| halogens                         | halides |
| -------------------------------- | ------- |
| Cl2  + 2e  $\rightleftharpoons$  | 2Cl-    |
| Br2    + 2e $\rightleftharpoons$ | 2Br-    |
| I2  + 2e   $\rightleftharpoons$  | 2I-     |
| (oxidising agents)               | reducing agent     |

- if a substance is coloured, it is not due the halides. hence only halogens and colours are listed on page 5 of data booklet.
- halides could be oxidised to halogens
- series of chemical reactions, observe outcomes, and then make predictions
1. Cl2 + Br- -> Cl- + Br2
- ox: $2Br^-\to Br_{2}+2\overline{e}$
- red: $Cl_{2}+2\overline{e}\to{2}Cl^-$ 
- yellow solution added to orange solution forming orange solution (?)
- cell potential calculations: $E_{\text{cell}}=E_{\text{red}}-E_{ox}=1.36-1.08=+0.28V$ positive, therefore feasible.
1. $Cl_{2} + 2I^- \to 2Cl^- + I_{2}$
- ox: 
- red: $Cl_{2} + 2\overline{e} \to 2Cl^-$
3. $Br_{2} + Cl^-$
- no visible reaction
4. $Br_{2} + 2I^- \to 2Br^- + I_{2}$
5. $I_{2}+Cl^-$
- no visible reaction
6. $I_{2}+Br-$
- no visible reaction

## Galvanic Cells & Daniel Cells
- what is galvanic cell:
	- a galvanic cell uses two half-reactions in separate containers and makes use of the spontaneous nature of the reactions to generate an electric current. potential chemical energy converted to potential energy.
	- the transfer of electrons in the redox reactions is harnessed through physical separation of the two half-equations.
### daniel cells
- this is a daniel cell
- ![[notes/images/Screenshot 2023-11-21 at 12.45.58 pm.png]]
- purpose of salt bridge: joins the two half cells. complete the circuit and \___ ms pilling will give booklet with better description. movement of ions in salt bridge allows flow of charge through the cell and complete the circuit.
- purpose of high-resistance voltmeter: reduce the current because you don't want dramatic drop in voltage.
- zinc is more reactive, so oxidises and loses electrons that flow blah blah blah blah
