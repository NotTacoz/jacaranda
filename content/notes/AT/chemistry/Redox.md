Consider checking out the [[notes/AT/chemistry/Edward ATAR 12 Redox Seminar Masterclass|Edward ATAR 12 Redox Seminar Masterclass]] for a shortened version of the entire Redox course.
## Redox Introduction
- **Red**uction & **Ox**idation
>[!Note] Read question carefully depending if it asks you to explain in reduction or oxidation.
- Reduction
	- gain of electrons
- Oxidation
	- loss of electrons.
- due to conservation of matter, reduction and oxidation is the exchange of electrons, and happens simultaneously.
- OILRIG
	- oxidation is loss, reduction is gain
- example:
	- oxidisation: $Na\to Na^++\overline{e}$  (oxidation half equation)
	- reduction: $Cl_{2}+2\overline{e}\to 2Cl^-$ (reduction half equation)
	- balance: $2Na\to 2Na^++ 2\overline{e}$
	- combine: $Cl_{2}+2Na\to 2NaCl+2\overline{e}$ (full redox equation)
	- Consider the oxidation number
		- Cl2: 0
		- 2Na: 0
		- 2NaCl: +1 -1
		- increase in oxidation number: oxidation
		- decrease in oxidation number: reduction
## common types of redox reactions
- metal metal ion displacement
	- metal transfers ions 
- halogen halide ion displacement
	- electrons transferred to a halogen, halides to less reactive halogen
- combustion
- corrosion
## Oxidation Numbers
- increase in oxidation number: oxidation
- decrease in oxidation number: reduction

>[!Important]
>
>Oxidation number (oxidation state): A number assigned to the atom to show how many electrons lost, gained or shared unequally (to form a bond). 
- Oxidation number of Na: 0
- Oxidation number of Cl2: 0
- Oxidation number of Na in NaCl: +1
- Oxidation number of Cl in NaCl: -1
- Oxidation number of H in HCl: +1
- Oxidation number of Cl in HCl: -1
- Oxidation number of H in H2O: +1
- Oxidation number of O in H2O: -2
- Oxidation number of F in F2O: -1
- Oxidation number of O in F2O: +2
	- because F is more electronegative than oxygen

| elements with fixed oxidation states in their compounds | oxidation state |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| hydrogen (except in metal hydrides - metal combined with hydrogen & fluorine)                     | +1 (-1)         |
| oxygen (except in peroxides)                            | -2 (-1)         |
| group I elements                                        | +1              |
| group II elements                                       | +2              |
| aluminium                                               | +3              |
| halide                                                  | -1                |

- for uncombined elements, the oxidation state is zero
- for atoms in elements (when element combined to itself), the oxidation state is zero.
- for simple ions, the oxidation state is the charge of the ion.
	- e.g. $Na^+Cl^-$ +1 and -1
- electronegativity: ability to attract bonding pair of electrons hence something peroxide (???)
- halides: ions of halogens

| halogens | halides |
| -------- | ------- |
| $F_{2}$  | $F^-$   |
| $Cl_{2}$ | $Cl^-$  |
| $Br_{2}$ | $Br^-$  |
| $I_{2}$  | $I^-$        |

- if theres one other electron added to it it is not a halide!

>[!warning] by convention put oxidation number **under** element, and the total **above** element. this is a common mistake !!

>[!warning] 
>BE SPECIFIC AND BE PARTICULAR. DO NOT BE VAGUE. EXPLAIN WELL AND LOGICALLY. E.G. "IT" NO GOOD 🙅

- in oxidation, the thing being oxidised is called the reducing agent!
	- vice versa
	- H2O something something idk
	- decrease in oxidation number: reducing: oxidation agent!
		- An oxidising agent accepts electrons and is itself reduced.
	- increase in oxidation number: oxidising: reducing agent!
		- A reducing agent donates electrons and is itself oxidised.
	- すごい

## Writing Balanced Equations
### Practice
Copper (I) Oxide
- Cu2O
Manganese (IV) Oxide
- MnO2
Iron (III) Sulphate
- Fe2(SO4)3
### New Types of Acids:
- Chloric (I) acid
	- Cl is +1 because O is more electronegative :)
	- $HClO$
- Chloric (V) acid
	- $HClO_{3}$

### Combining Half Equations
- Combine it to write balanced equations!
- Reactants go together with reactants products go together with reactants.
- cancel everything out.

## Balancing Redox Equations in Acidic Conditions
0. Assign Oxidation Numbers
1. Write the skeletons of the oxidation and reduction half-equations.
2. Balance all elements other than H and O
3. Balance the oxygen atoms by adding H2O (where needed)
4. Balance the hydrogen atoms by adding H+ ions (where needed)
5. Balance the charge by adding electrons, e-
6. If the number of electrons lost in the oxidation half-reaction is not equal to the number of electrons gained in the reduction half-reaction, multiply one or both of the half-reactions by a number that will make the number of electrons gained equal to the number of electrons lost.
7. Add the 2 half-reactions as if they were mathematical equations. The electrons will always cancel If the same formulas are found on opposite sides of the half-reactions, you can cancel them. If the same formulas are founded on the same side of both half-reactions, combine them.
8. Check to make sure the atoms and the charges balance.

## disproportionation
- 1 substance is simultaneously oxidised and reduced
- has the general equation: $$A+A\to B+C$$
## displacement reaction of halogens
- describing appearance of halogens
- ms pilling demonstration

| halogens                         | halides |
| -------------------------------- | ------- |
| Cl2  + 2e  $\rightleftharpoons$  | 2Cl-    |
| Br2    + 2e $\rightleftharpoons$ | 2Br-    |
| I2  + 2e   $\rightleftharpoons$  | 2I-     |
| (oxidising agents)               | reducing agent     |

- if a substance is coloured, it is not due the halides. hence only halogens and colours are listed on page 5 of data booklet.
- halides could be oxidised to halogens
- series of chemical reactions, observe outcomes, and then make predictions
1. Cl2 + Br- -> Cl- + Br2
- ox: $2Br^-\to Br_{2}+2\overline{e}$
- red: $Cl_{2}+2\overline{e}\to{2}Cl^-$ 
- yellow solution added to orange solution forming orange solution (?)
- cell potential calculations: $E_{\text{cell}}=E_{\text{red}}-E_{ox}=1.36-1.08=+0.28V$ positive, therefore feasible.
1. $Cl_{2} + 2I^- \to 2Cl^- + I_{2}$
- ox: 
- red: $Cl_{2} + 2\overline{e} \to 2Cl^-$
3. $Br_{2} + Cl^-$
- no visible reaction
4. $Br_{2} + 2I^- \to 2Br^- + I_{2}$
5. $I_{2}+Cl^-$
- no visible reaction
6. $I_{2}+Br-$
- no visible reaction

## Electrochemical Cells
### Galvanic Cells & Daniel Cells
- what is galvanic cell:
	- a galvanic cell uses two half-reactions in separate containers and makes use of the spontaneous nature of the reactions to generate an electric current. potential chemical energy converted to potential energy.
	- the transfer of electrons in the redox reactions is harnessed through physical separation of the two half-equations.
#### daniel cells
- this is a daniel cell
- ![[notes/images/Screenshot 2023-11-21 at 12.45.58 pm.png]]
- purpose of salt bridge: joins the two half cells. complete the circuit and \___ ms pilling will give booklet with better description. movement of ions in salt bridge allows flow of charge through the cell and complete the circuit.
- purpose of high-resistance voltmeter: **reduce the current because you don't want dramatic drop in voltage.**
- zinc is more reactive, so oxidises and loses electrons that flow blah blah blah blah
- the solid thingy is usually graphite or platinum.
## Anode and Cathode
- An ox & Red cat
- Anode is negative, Cathode is positive (in galvanic cells only - in electrolytic cells anode is positive and cathode is negative!)

## Feasibility of a Reaction
- A reaction is **thermodynamically feasible** if calculated $E_{\text{cell}}$ is positive.
- choose to change sign or not -> if it is changed it is - oxidised instead.
	- same outcome lol - depends on question on what you need to do, mathematically they are the same formula.
	- +- oxidised depending on if sign is changed.

## Sacrificial Anode
- sacrificial anode: strong reducing agent (more reactive) metal that will be oxidised preferentially attached to iron (or other metals) to protect it (from oxidising)

## Ms Pilling on Self Study
>[!quote] its like any other sport - you dont do training, you dont exercise, you dont get the prize

## Cathodic protection
- ICCP, Impressed Current Cathodic Protection systems are used to provide cathodic protection for pipelines, ship hulls, offshore production platforms, water treatment equipment etc.
- principal advantage of ICCP is greater output capacity compared to sacrificial anode systems - therefore when protection is desired for large, poorly coated and bare structures ICCP is often choice.
- it requires external DC power source that is energised by standard AC current.
- insert cathodic protection diagram 
	- protected structure
	- ![[notes/images/Pasted image 20231130152043.png|500]]
- sea water
	- many different ions: sodium ion
		- sodium ion -> metal
		- too much energy, not provided
- enough energy to turn chloride into chlorine! (oxidised) on anode
	- moving to cathode, and chlorine is reduced to chloride
		- if theres enough current, could happen (?)
### sacrificial anode CP method vs impressed current CP method
- sacrific
	- no external source of power
	- spontaneous reactions
	- oxidised more readily than iron
	- cathodic protection
- impressed current
	- metal and anode, less reactive, acting as cathode.
	- non spontaneous reaction.

## Corrosion
- oxidisation of a metal
- usually occurs in the presence of oxygen and water vapour in the air to form metal oxide.
### dry corrosion
- dry corrosion/oxidation occurs when oxygens or other reactive gases in air reacts with exposed metal without the presence of a liquid. This causes an oxide layer to form over the metal, which damages its surface properties.
	- oxide layer called rust.
	- dry corrosion requires contact between air and metal, so oxide layer forms eventually stops (as it no longer is in contact because the layer prevents it)
		- this stopping is known as passivation.
- oxide layer is **porous** in some cases, and thus corrosion can continue deep into the material.
	- known as active corrosion.
	- porous is basically having holes
- dry corrosion is sensitive to temperature: reacts faster under application of heat (no way rate of reaction???!)
### 3 types of dry corrosion
#### oxidative corrosion
- point of contact between metal and o2 gas: o2 gas is reduce and oxidises metal
	- this forms metal oxide.
- metal oxide may be stable: adhere onto non-corroded metal; this prevents more contact between o2 and metal; therefore no more corrosion.
- the metal oxide may be stable: but NOT adhere onto the non-corroded metal (i.e. might flake away): it then fails to prevent direct contact between oxygen gas and metal, and metal corrosion continues
#### liquid metal corrosion
- occurs when liquid metal is allowed to flow over solid metal at high temperature.
- one example is flow of sodium metal (used as coolant) over cadmium. cadmium is corroded and sodium ions are reduced.
#### corrosion by other gases

## Fuel cells
- h2 and o2 come to make h2o
	- this is foundation of fuel cells.
- spontaneous reaction, produce lots of energy. 
- anode is where hydrogen are
- cathode has oxygen
- electrons travels from anode to cathode.
- electrolytes block.
- catalyst helps hydrogen gas to split apart
### advantages
- uses external fuel source, so not reliant on limited store capacity
- high efficiency
- emission-free; zero emissions, only water vapour
- high energy density: a lot of energy in small volume
- renewable: hydrogen can be produced from renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, hydropower
### disadvantages
- high cost to produce a fuel cell
- production/transportation/distribution/storage problems with hydrogen
- <mark style="background: #FFFD00B0;">developing technology ? i think you have to expand on this. check practice tests later and come back. </mark>
## applications of redox: primary/secondary/fuel cells blah bla
### cells and batteries
- redox: transfer of electrons between 2 substances. separate galvanic cells and the movement of electrons between external circuit to generate electricity.
- **electrochemical cell** is a store of chemical energy in **closed system:** closed regards with chemical substance, all reactants and products contained within the battery, but not closed with respect to energy transfer (physics concept woohoo)
- split into *primary* and *secondary* cells (rechargeable and non-rechargeable respectively)
- secondary cell can be discharged and recharged =D
- size of battery means more chemicals inside which means it can run for a longer amount of time; it does not affect the voltage output.
>[!note] a **battery** is more than one cell connected together in a series arrangement

- the **electromotive force** (voltage) increases when the cell is connected together in series. voltage = sum of voltages of each cell.
- a battery is a closed system which contains high energy reactants and low energy products in a sealed unit.
### primary cell
- lots and lots of primary cell but only two we learn =D they all have *relatively* similar patterns.
- one use wonder! non reversible.
- advantages
	- cheap
	- don't discharge unless power is drawn
### zinc-carbon dry cell - **leclanche** cell
- ![[notes/images/Screenshot 2024-02-01 at 12.49.12 pm.png|400]]
- produces 1.5V
- carbon is inert (non-reactive) and conductive electrode: hence why it is used. if a metal is used, it would react and that wouldn't be poggers.
- porous fibre is like filter paper fr no cap.
- allows outside to move between the thing and the slightly red paste; outside is zinc.
- excess zinc is used, so it won't be entirely consumed and the zinc ions wont leak everywhere.
- half reacitons:
	- ox $Zn(s)\to Zn^{2+}+2e^-$
	- red: $2MnO_{2}(s)+2NH_{4}^++2e^-\to Mn_{2}O_{3}+2NH_{3}+H_{2}O$
	- full $2MnO_{2}(s)+2NH_{4}^++Zn(s)\to Zn^{2+}+Mn_{2}O_{3}+2NH_{3}+H_{2}O$
- disadvantages
	- low energy to mass ratio
- advantages
### alkaline cell
- uses zinc and mangaese(IV) oxide, but uses potassium hydroxide paste as electrolyte.
- alkaline cells do not need lots of electrolyte, so more space for reactants.
- thus it has higher energy to mass ratio as a result.
- ![[notes/images/Screenshot 2024-02-01 at 1.02.27 pm.png]]
## secondary cells (rechargeable)
- secondary cells are a massive part of the modern world
- utilises fairly new (with regards to redox topic)
- we make things go backwards (do, undo, redo, undo blah blah blah)
- process that goes both ways :fire: bars
- rechargeable cells got invented
- chemical energy -> discharge spontaneous energy -> electrical energy -> recharge non-spontaneous reaction -> chemical energy
- ![[notes/images/Screenshot 2024-02-02 at 1.40.16 pm.png|400]]
- once discharged, recharged by applying **dc voltage** (have to mention dc voltage!)
- we do not use reversible symbols in redox equations; discharge with forward arrow or recharge with a forward arrow
### nickel metal hydride cells
- dont need to memorise diagram
- nickel metal hydride batteries results in high demand for nickel.
- mysterious rare-earth metals: alloy, store hydrogen as hydride
- recharge reverses reaction; in this case me turn the metal alloy back into hydride, so we do half reaction in opposite direction.
- talk about polarity later
	- ms holland will talk about electrolysis first
### lead acid battery
- CAR BATTERIES
- NOT TESLA BATTERIES. REGULAR PETROL-DIESEL
- PURPOSE IS TO TURN THE STARTER MOTOR.
- delivers HIGH VOLTAGE and HIGH CURRENT to turn over the motor getting it starting, reducing the mechanical resistance.
- each cell produces 2V, car battery uses 6 cells in series to output 12V
- advantages
	- cheap reliable
	- very reliable, withstand many discharge-recharge cycles: long lifetime
	- output large current
- disadvantages
	- low energy density
	- safety hazards; corrosive sulphuric acid electrolyte; toxic lead compounds.
		- if broke, waterway can say byebye
	- environmental concern upon end of life.
		- horrible pollutant, lead will troll the environment.
- porous anode, to increase surface area
- cathode made with lead (4) oxide
- all good to go again once recharged.
### lithium ion battery
- lithium exists in cathode and in electrolyte.
- cathode made with lithium cobalt oxide
- when battery is fully charged, we shoved lithiums in graphite
- discharge reactions:
	- anode (-) Lic6 -> Li+ + c6 + e-
	- cathode (+) coO2 + Li+ + e- -> LiCoO2
	- redox: LiC6 + CoO2 -> C6 + LiCoO2
- different materials for two different electrodes results highly energetic favourable electrodes with different materials.
- recharged anode -> cathode, cathode -> anode.
- fire risk
	- banned on flights due to the fire risk they pose
	- 1. short-circuiting
		- porous separator keeps battery electrodes apart; charging for long periods can damage the porous membrane, removing it cause battery to discharge rapidly and generate a lot of heat.
	- 2. overcharging
		- when overcharged, lithium cobalt oxide releases oxygen. react with flammable electrolyte and also cobalt oxide
	- 3. electrolyte breakdown
		- electrolyte catches fire.

## Fuel Cells
- Does not form the definition of electrochemical cell.
- It is not a closed system, but it is instead an **open system**.
- It is not being used to replace batteries, we use it more often to replace a combustion engine.
- Direct replacement to engine in vehicles.
- Hydrogen Fuel Cell
- Combustion Reaction of Fuel is the only reaction simplified, unless it wants you to state the half equations.
- There are multiple kinds of fuel cells: 3 kinds of Hydrogen Oxygen cells (didn't catch what she said)
### Hydrogen Oxygen Cell
- Electrochemical Energy: Converts between CPE and EE
	- Spontaneous reaction: CPE -> EE (galvanic type redox reaction)
- Most common fuel cells
- Ms Holland likes anode on the left=D
- Pretty efficient, but it is a bit inefficient too, so some energy is converted to heat.
- Structure: Electrolyte (3 types of Hydrogen Oxygen Cells)
	- Acidic Kind: 
		- H2SO4 sulphuric acid
			- good for labs
			- not good for industries
		- phosphoric acid
			- good for industries
	- Alkaline: 
		- KOH (potassium hydroxide)
			- both lab and industries
	- PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane)
	- minor intricate differences between all 3
- Porous Carbon
	- Tiny Holes
	- +Catalyst (sometimes)
		- changes depending on version
- Anode, Cathode Compartment
- Electrical Energy comes from the movement of electrons.
- Increase voltage by connecting batteries in series.
- Advantages
	- Could replace power stations, main idea is to replace fossil fuel engines and batteries, which are both pollution.
	- Only requires Hydrogen and Oxygen, and does not produce Carbo Dioxide or pollutants.
	- Last longer than batteries, less polluting to dispose of.
- Disadvantages
	- Hydrogen is a gas
		- hard to fuel up, high flammable and not poggers.
	- more space to store than fossil fuels or batteries
	- Explosive when mixed with air
		- will explode in contact with air.
	- storage is dangerous
	- BIGGEST ISSUE: Hydrogen gas requires energy, and its often produced using fossil fuels.
- aqueous acidic hydrogen oxygen fuel cell: has extra thing at anode for depleted fuel and other gases to come out: catalyst provides conductive surface for thing to occur, platinum doesn't corrode (expensive for jewellery) 
- proton exchange membrane works similar to aqueous acidic.
- production of hydrogen
	- hydrogen is a very reactive element
		- reaction of hydrocarbons with steam
		- electrolysis of acidified water
- TRANSPORTING HYDROGEN
	- liquify under pressure
		- very hard tho, you can force it into liquid state with high pressure, but pressure is ridiculously low.
		- expensive method of storage
	- adsorption
		- take place at low pressure and close to room temperature
		- however, materials being used for adsorption does not last forever.
	- absorption
		- absorbed by solid materials, enter spaces in metal alloys lattices, forming hydrides
		- alloys deteriorate over time, and need to be replaced regularly
- hydrogen fuel bus
	- since transporting is difficult, some vehicles makes hydrogen using hydrogen-rich fuels and then using it with fuel cells.
- direct methanol fuel cells
	- ![[notes/images/Pasted image 20240206142509.png]]
	- anode: ch3oh + h2o -> 6h+ +6e- + co2
	- cathode: 3/2 o2 + 6h+ + 6e- -> 3h2o
	- redox: ch3oh + 3/2 o2 -> co2 + 2h2o
- making ethanol
	- less toxic more energy dense alcohol than methanol.
	- not ready, as catalysts are not cheap !! very expensive \$\$ ahhh
	- cheaper, more efficient catalysts capable of fully oxidising ethanol are needed.
- pros cons fuel cells
	- powerpoint slide on ms holland fuel cells ppt, put the slide here LATER AT SOME POINT ! THANKS!!!!
- breath alcohol tester.
	- fuel cell technology used to breath alcohol testers.
