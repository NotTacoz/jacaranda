Consider checking out the [[notes/AT/chemistry/Edward ATAR 12 Redox Seminar Masterclass|Edward ATAR 12 Redox Seminar Masterclass]] for a shortened version of the entire Redox course.
## Redox Introduction
- **Red**uction & **Ox**idation
>[!Note] Read question carefully depending if it asks you to explain in reduction or oxidation.
- Reduction
	- gain of electrons
- Oxidation
	- loss of electrons.
- due to conservation of matter, reduction and oxidation is the exchange of electrons, and happens simultaneously.
- OILRIG
	- oxidation is loss, reduction is gain
- example:
	- oxidisation: $Na\to Na^++\overline{e}$  (oxidation half equation)
	- reduction: $Cl_{2}+2\overline{e}\to 2Cl^-$ (reduction half equation)
	- balance: $2Na\to 2Na^++ 2\overline{e}$
	- combine: $Cl_{2}+2Na\to 2NaCl+2\overline{e}$ (full redox equation)
	- Consider the oxidation number
		- Cl2: 0
		- 2Na: 0
		- 2NaCl: +1 -1
		- increase in oxidation number: oxidation
		- decrease in oxidation number: reduction
## Oxidation Numbers
- increase in oxidation number: oxidation
- decrease in oxidation number: reduction

>[!Important]
>
>Oxidation number (oxidation state): A number assigned to the atom to show how many electrons lost, gained or shared unequally (to form a bond). 
- Oxidation number of Na: 0
- Oxidation number of Cl2: 0
- Oxidation number of Na in NaCl: +1
- Oxidation number of Cl in NaCl: -1
- Oxidation number of H in HCl: +1
- Oxidation number of Cl in HCl: -1
- Oxidation number of H in H2O: +1
- Oxidation number of O in H2O: -2
- Oxidation number of F in F2O: -1
- Oxidation number of O in F2O: +2
	- because F is more electronegative than oxygen

| elements with fixed oxidation states in their compounds | oxidation state |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| hydrogen (except in metal hydrides - metal combined with hydrogen & fluorine)                     | +1 (-1)         |
| oxygen (except in peroxides)                            | -2 (-1)         |
| group I elements                                        | +1              |
| group II elements                                       | +2              |
| aluminium                                               | +3              |
| halide                                                  | -1                |

- for uncombined elements, the oxidation state is zero
- for atoms in elements (when element combined to itself), the oxidation state is zero.
- for simple ions, the oxidation state is the charge of the ion.
	- e.g. $Na^+Cl^-$ +1 and -1
- electronegativity: ability to attract bonding pair of electrons hence something peroxide (???)
- halides: ions of halogens

| halogens | halides |
| -------- | ------- |
| $F_{2}$  | $F^-$   |
| $Cl_{2}$ | $Cl^-$  |
| $Br_{2}$ | $Br^-$  |
| $I_{2}$  | $I^-$        |

- if theres one other electron added to it it is not a halide!

>[!warning] by convention put oxidation number **under** element, and the total **above** element. this is a common mistake !!

>[!warning] 
>BE SPECIFIC AND BE PARTICULAR. DO NOT BE VAGUE. EXPLAIN WELL AND LOGICALLY. E.G. "IT" NO GOOD üôÖ

- in oxidation, the thing being oxidised is called the reducing agent!
	- vice versa
	- H2O something something idk
	- decrease in oxidation number: reducing: oxidation agent!
		- An oxidising agent accepts electrons and is itself reduced.
	- increase in oxidation number: oxidising: reducing agent!
		- A reducing agent donates electrons and is itself oxidised.

## Writing Balanced Equations
### Practice
Copper (I) Oxide
- Cu2O
Manganese (IV) Oxide
- MnO2
Iron (III) Sulphate
- Fe2(SO4)3
### New Types of Acids:
- Chloric (I) acid
	- Cl is +1 because O is more electronegative :)
	- $HClO$
- Chloric (V) acid
	- $HClO_{3}$

### Combining Half Equations
- Combine it to write balanced equations!
- Reactants go together with reactants products go together with reactants.
- cancel everything out.
