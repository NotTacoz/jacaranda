## redox questions
- redox reactions involve transfer of one or more electrons from one species to another.
### electrochemistry in action!
- what is electrolysis
	- a process where **electricity** is used to make a **chemical change** happen that wouldn't happen otherwise. (non-spontaneous)
- types of galvanic cells
	- primary cell, secondary cell, fuel cell.
- primary cell definition
	- non-rechargeable galvanic cells
	- contains fixed amount of oxidant and reductant, which once consumed cannot be replaced/regenerated.
- secondary cell definition
	- rechargeable.
- how are secondary cells recharged?
	- applied dc voltage forcing current through cell in opposite direction to that it spontaneously reacted during **discharge**.
- describe the process of recharging
	- electrolysis where electrical energy is used to force the spontaneous discharge reactions to be reversed, and in the process, regenerate oxidant and reductant originally present in the charged cell.
	- tldr; reverses the original reactions and turns the products back into its original reactants.
- drawbacks of secondary cells?
	- there is a limit to number of recharge cycle, 
	- as electrodes becomes physically degraded over time, and no longer able to be recharged
- what are fuel cells.
	- oxidants and reductant are continously being fed into the cell.
	- the cell is a combustible substance: fuel.
- examples of fuel cells
	- hydrogen, methane, methanol.
- what is usually oxidant of fuel cell
	- oxygen gas
- advantages of fuel cells
	- very long life
	- theoretically operate without limit as long as the oxidant and reductant are supplied into the cell.
- what is a dry cell
	- simplest, most inexpensive of primary cells (non-rechargeable cells)
- disadvantages of dry cell
	- produces max voltage of 1.5 V
	- voltage produced slowly decreases over lifetime of cell.
	- very low energy to mass ratio (energy density)
	- cannot be recharged (primary cell)
	- ammonium ions cause zinc anode to dissolve forming Zn2+ ions, thus it has low shelf life (~1 year)
- advantages of dry cell
	- inexpensive
	- ideal for use in flashlight, portable radios and calculators where low currents are required and decreasing voltage is not an issue.
	- materials used in dry cell (Zn, MnO2, Nh4Cl and C) pose negligible environmental impact. spent dry cells are considered non-hazardous waste and can be disposed of in normal household.
- materials used in dry cell
	- Zinc Zn
	- Manganese Dioxide MnO2
	- Ammonium Chloride NH4Cl
	- Carbon C
- types of primary cells
	- dry cells
	- alkaline cell
	- silver oxide button cells
	- lithium cells

- oxidation half reaction for dry cell
	- Zn(s)->Zn2+ + 2e-
- reduction half reaction for dry cell
	- 2MnO2 (s) + 2NH4+ (aq) + 2e- -> Mn2O3 (s) + 2NH3 (aq) + H2O (l)
- net reaction for dry cell
	- 2MnO2 (s) + 2NH4+ (aq) + Zn (s) ->  Zn2+(aq) + Mn2O3 (s) + 2NH3 (aq) + H2O (l)
- what is reducing agent in alkaline cell
	- zinc (like dry cell)
- what is the oxidising agent in alkaline cell
	- MnO2 manganese dioxide
- difference dry cell and alkaline cell, and impact
	- instead of ammonium chloride electrolyte, it uses potassium hydroxide.
		- considerable improves shelf life by eliminating effect of acidic ammonium ions that ultimately dissolve zinc anode of dry cell.
	- zinc anode is powdered zinc, instead of zinc foil in dry cell.
		- <mark style="background: #FFFD00B0;">provides more surface area for chemical reactions to take place compared to foil. lowers internal resistance of cell</mark> **(?)**
	- greater mass of reductant, Zn and oxidant, MnO2 than dry cell of similar size.
		- higher energy density and longer operating life.
- oxidation half reaction in alkaline cell
	- Zn (s) + 2OH- (aq) -> ZnO (s) + H2O (l) + 2e-
- reduction half reaction in alkaline cell
	- 2MnO2(s) + H2O(l) + 2e- -> Mn2O3 (s) + 2OH- (aq)
- overall redox reaction: 
	- Zn(s) + 2MnO2(s) -> ZnO(s) + Mn2O3 (s)
- where is alkaline cells used
	- higher current flow devices
		- toys, portable radios, cd players, electronic games & torches.
- benefits of alkaline cells
	- minimal environmental impact (same as dry cells)
		- considered non-hazardous waste.
- disadvantages
	- disposed in normal household waste stream.
	- no economic process for recycling the materials in these cells.
