## SRP
- SRP is standard reduction potential (left to right)
- Higher SRP means it preferentially reduce than the half-reaction with lower SRP.
- right to left is SOP (standard oxidation potential)
## SOP: SRP in reverse
- Ecell = Ered + Eoxd
- **turn chemical potential energy into electrical energy** when two systems react.
- driving force of a redox reaction is because it is energetically favourable to happen.
	- occurs **spontaneously**
		- (no energy input)
- if Ecell is positive, then reaction occurs spontaneously.
- Look at half equation thing at back of data booklet.

## Electrochemical cells
- device that transforms energy between chemical potential energy and electrical energy: two types **Galvanic** and **Electrolytic**
- galvanic are electrochemical (converts chemical potential energy into electrical energy)
	- multiple galvanic cells are connected in series we form a battery.
- electrolytic cells are electrochemical cells convert electrical energy into chemical potential energy.
### galvanic cell definition
1. a type of electrochemical cell that transforms chemical potential energy into electrical energy
2. In a spontaneous redox reaction that produces a voltage (potential difference)
3. That drives an electrical current.

## setup galvanic cells
- electrons takes path of least resistance.
	- physically separating the oxidant and reductant into "half-cells"
- electrons are forced to flow through external circuit.
- need voltmeter measuring electrical potential - called the external wire.
	- measures flow of electrons. (LABEL THIS)
	- anode and cathode
- both half cells are called electrodes
	- because electrons flow in and out of the thingy
	- electrodes have to be conductive
- electrolytes should be 1molL^-1 (because thats what standard reduction potential is measured at)
- electrons flow from anode to cathode.
- anode a negative charge and cathode a positive charge (?)
- stores some reagents, allows flow of charge within the cell.
### external circuit
- a conductor is joining the 2 electrodes
- forces electrons to flow through external circuit.
- provides pathway for electrons to flow through without cathode/anode touching.
## setup idkidkidkidk
- electrons come out of the anode -> go to cathode turning it into silver solvent.
- electrons are moving from anode to cathode IF the salt bridge didn't exist, the cathode would become negative and anode becomes positive, but salt bridge balances the charge
- if cathode became way too negative, it would repel the electrons away and reverse the reaction Idk. if the anode was very very positive, it keeps electrons to itself.
- salt bridge keeps cells *fairly* neutral.
- anions negative idk.
- salt bridge is non-reactive electrolyte solution.
- potassium nitrate or sodium nitrate good salt bridges i think.
- anode is ASSIGNED positive charge - describes behaviour of electrons.
- electrons are coming towards it, cathode attracts electrons, so we assign it a positive charge - because it is attracting an opposite, negative charge.

## galvanic cells summary tldr
- at anode, material oxidised and electrons are liberated.
- the electrons flow through the external circuit towards the cathode
- at cathode, material is reduced (gains these e-)
- due to electron transfer, electrodes gain slight charge so:
	- cations flow to the cathode via salt bridge
	- anions flow to the anode via salt bridge
- prevents charge accumulation and completes the circuit
- chemical potential energy is converted to electrical energy
- overtime reagents used and concentration decreases
	- rate of redox reaction decreases
	- causes the current (n electrons flower/unit time) to decrease and voltage is prop to current, voltage delivered decreases as cell discharges
	- hence why battery becomes "weak" as they discharge.
- $\text{rate of reaction }\propto \text{ no of electrons produced -> no of electrons flowing through external wire}$
>[!note] may be question on condensed galvanic cell notation

1. galvanic half cells are represented as two couples: oxidised and reduced.
2. couples are separated by a salt bridge represented by ||
3. oxidised couple is placed before reduced couple
4. single line '|' separates components of teh couple. within, the reactant is placed first
