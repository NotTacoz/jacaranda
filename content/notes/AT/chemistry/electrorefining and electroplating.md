- electrorefining
	- extracting pure metal (mixture) electrolyte

- 4) at the cathode: SRP:  Li+, Na+, Fe2+
- metals that are more R(eactive) produce cations with lower SRP values
- as E cell = SRP of Fe2+, anything w/ lower SRP: does not reduce!
- anything more reactive than iron will just remain in solution.
- separation 1: anode (less reactive)
- separation 2: cathode (more reactive)
- 3 types of metal in the thingy
	- the metal itself
	- metal more reactive (higher sop)
	- metal less reactive (lower sop)
