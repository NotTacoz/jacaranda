- concentration of reactants decrease
- frequency of successful collisions decrease
	- between cathode and electrolyte, anode and electrolyte
	- rate of reaction decreases
- if a singular reaction occurs per second
	- current = Q/t x transfer of electrons (rate) decreases
	- if rate of reaction goes down, the transfer of electrons is slowing down.
- current decreases
	- therefore emf decreases
- what is way of fixing this?
	- fuel cells: lit-ion battery
		- no longer in course because research is ongoing
		- nickel cad
- why sulfuric acid and other polyprotic acid not allowed
	- we are only allowed to work with H+ ions in a 1mol/L
	- we are operating SRP => H+ > 1.0 mol/L
	- if we change the concentration, then the order of rankings will change
	- citric acid and organic acids are weak acids
		- the concentration doesnt have 1mol/L of hydrogen either, if you put 1mol/L in.
- higher elevation = lower pressure lower temperature
	- rate of reaction decreases
	- voltage decreases
- electrolyte concentration and voltage developed.
	- if concentration increases, rate of reaction increases and voltage increase.
	- the time it last does not depend concentration, it depends on moles (?) which depends on the size of the battery.
- concentration => ror => v
- moles => duration
- internal resistance
	- corrosion of e- comp
	- decrease ion mobility = load/acid battery (?)
- voltage/time graph
