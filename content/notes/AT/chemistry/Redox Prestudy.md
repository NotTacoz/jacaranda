- Redox
	- Reactions
		- OILRIG
			- Reduction
				- Process involving gain of electrons
			- Oxidation
				- Process involving loss of electrons
		- Oxidation Numbers
- Electrolysis
	- Definition
		- A process where electricity is used to make a chemical change happen that wouldn't happen otherwise.
	- Electrical energy from battery force non spontaneous reactions to react
	- electrolytic cell
		- battery
			- + pulls electrons, oxidising.
			- - will push electrons, reducing it.
		- electrode
			- definition:
				- conductor which electricity leaves an object
			- cathode
				- reduction happens
			- anode
				- oxidation happens
		- electrolyte
			- needs to be molten/aqueous
- electrochemistry
	- electrochemical cells
		- galvanic cells
			- components
				- half-cells
					- oxidation half-cell
					- reduction half-cell
				- two electrodes
					- anode
					- cathode
				- voltmeter (connected to external circuit)
				- electrolyte
				- external circuit
				- salt bridge
					- purpose of salt bridge
						- prevents direct contact between oxidising and reducing agents, allowing ions to pass between them.
					- direction of ions salt bridge
						- anions flow towards anode, cations flow towards cathode.
			- electron flow
				- anode -> cathode
			- polarity
				- anode: negative
				- cathode: positive
			- daniel cell
			- types of galvanic cells
				- primary cell
					- dry cell
				- secondary cells (rechargeable)
					- lead-acid cell
				- fuel cell
					- oxidant/reductant continuously fed into cell.
		- electrolytic cells
			- 
- applied electrochemistry
	- electro refining of copper
		- copper high resistance corrosion and good conductivity of electricity makes it great metal.
		- only useful if pure (>99.95% Cu)
		- blister copper extracted usually (around 98% Cu)
