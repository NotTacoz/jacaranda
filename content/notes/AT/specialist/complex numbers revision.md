- factor remainder theorem
	- f(\_) = 0
	- expand it out just in case they are picky
- therefore __ is a factor of f(x)
- know how long division works its good, but preferred using the factor way frfr
- very easy to make silly mistake, so double check it!
	- even goats can make mistakes
- keep in mind what the question is asking for: if solutions, give solutions.
- say the eq has all real coefficients (sometimes markers picky, especially in shenton, so better safe than sorry)
- polar form -> rectangular form is useful
- if you see i convert it to cis frfr , since it is cis(pi/2)
## geometric interpretation
- convert to polar form

- find angle, then talk about how its dilated by sqrt()< anad its rotated about origin by an amount =D
## question type 6- solving polynomials
- important will def come up
- find difference between answers if they are all equal it is correct
- perimeter, area

## binomial expansion
- revise binomial expansioni
