## Horizontal Circular Motion
![[notes/images/Pasted image 20240205121956.png|300]]
- If the speed and direction is constant, there is no *unbalanced* force acting on it.
	- thus it won't accelerate
	- if you change direction, by definition, your velocity is no longer constant, thus you are accelerating.
- 3 ways to be perfectly horizontal with the pendulum.
	- ball on the string with wings?
	- if the object is massless, then string is massless
- direction: towards centre of circular motion
	- Fc = Centrifugal force
	- Fa = Centrifugal acceleration
>[!note] vector quantities **must** have direction: <u>always</u> towards centre of circular motion

- Centripetal = "centre-seeking"
- Centrifugal force is not a force: mention it and you get put in the vacuum chamber
	- One or more real forces must supply the centripetal force. the Fc is sometimes net or a resultant force. i.e. definitely not real!
## Real forces
- gravity
- Friction: sideways friction between tyres and road on roundabout.
- tension: in both direction at all points. typically in high school physics, you say along the rope (usually you get away with that), direction towards the point of attachment

>[!Warning] You will lose marks if you put in non-real forces (centrifugal forces) in a free-body diagram. If you are itching to... use dotted lines...

## Electrical/Magnetic
- ???

## Reaction Force/Normal Force
- Force pushing you forward

## 13/2/24
- practice questions with satellite
- average ormonde class.
- did 2 practice questions and called it a day.

- Vertical Circular Motion Next Lesson
- Draw free body diagram, draw banked diagram, solve. dont memorise the type of circular motion questions!

## Vertical Circular Motion

T_20 =20.13
T = 1.0065
r = 80cm
m = 1kg
g = 9.80ms^-2
a_c = 31.1761272379ms^-2
T_top = 10.688063619
T_bottom = 20.488063619
$v_{avg}$ = (2pi\*0.8)/1.0065 = 4.9940866823ms^-1
$v_{top}$ = 6.5ms^-1
$v_{bottom}$ = 8.5ms^-1

## Gravity
- Definition: Gravity is <u>force</u> of <u>mutual attraction</u> between any and all objects of <u>mass</u> extending to infinity (to the limits of the universe) and which decreases with distance as per the inverse square law.
- Dr Waters has a talent of singing.
- John (garfield) is attracting Dr Waters
- Inverse square law: if you're far away from an object, you won't be pulled in, but there is still an attraction between you and the object.
- A Field is the region of space time around an object which passes a particular property (e.g. mass) which gives rise to the field and within which other objects with the appropriate property (e.g. mags) experience Force.

$F_{g}=\frac{GM_{1}M_{2}}{r^2}$
- r is distance between the two objects
- G is constant.
- M1 is mass of first object
- M2 is mass of second object.
- "PLANT XOB and planet xib" - dr waters
- mutual attraction, inverse square law - constant G = $6.67 \times 10^{-11} Nm^2kg^-2$
	- dont mess this up with planck constant :((.
		- the two numbers are similar.
consider coulombs law: $F=\frac{kq_{1}q_{2}}{r^2}$
- no way same formula, just values are different
- m x a = xkg^2/m^2
- x = m^2 s * m^-2/kg

- 3.64 x 10^6
- a_c = 2,876.25 ms^2
