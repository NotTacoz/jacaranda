## Gravity is Universal
- This implies that all objects attract each other with a force of gravitational attraction.
- This force is dependent on the mass of the objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two objects (known as the inverse square law).
### Gravity Distance Mass Law $$F_{gravity} \propto \frac{m_{1}+m_{2}}{d^2}$$
- Generally:
	- Higher Mass -> Higher Force (2x Mass -> 2x Force)
	- Higher Distance -> Lower Force (2x Distance -> 1/4x Force)
## Law of Universal Gravitation
- Any mass located in close proximity will experience a gravitational force. This force can be calculated as: $$F=\frac{GMm}{r^2}$$
- F = force between two mass (N)
- G = Universal Gravitational Constant $6.67 \times 10^{-11} m^3kg^{-1}s^{-2}$
- M = mass object 1 (kg)
- m = mass object 2 (kg)
- r = the distance between object 1 and 2 (m)

## Gravitational Fields // Effects of Gravity
- Because two objects mutually attract one another (e.g. the force that earth pulls the moon with is same as the force the moon pulls the earth with):
- **it does not matter which mass we call M and which we call m**
### Weight, Apparent Weight, and Weightlessness
- Mass: A measure of amount of matter in an object.
- Weight: A measure of the force of gravity on an object.
- Using Newton's third law, we know that, if a person stands stationary on level ground, they will experience a normal force from the ground equal and opposite to the force of gravity on them. This is their apparent weight.
- $F_{net}=F_{N}+F_{g}=F_{N}+(-F_{g})=F_{N}=F_{net}+F_{g}$
- If an elevator moves downwards, there is a net force pointing towards the ground, therefore the person in the elevator will feel lighter.
>[!note] teacher recommends to draw a diagram in questiosn like this.
- If acceleration downwards is equal to gravity, N = mg - ma = ma - ma = 0. Therefore you would be weightless. This is true for all objects in free fall!
- When in orbit, space station experiences gravitational acceleration of $g = \frac{Gm}{r^2}$. Since i is orbiting in a circle, it must also be accelerating towards centre (centripetal acceleration - 2024 topic)
- If the centripetal acceleration is equal to the gravitational acceleration, there is no normal force, therefore you would be weightless.

## Gravity, Kelper's 3rd Law & Energy Conservation
- NO ANGULAR MOMENTUM !
- 4 fundamental forces
	- gravity
	- electromagnetism
	- snf (LAST TOPIC)
	- wnf (LAST TOPIC)
- $F_{g} = G\frac{(mM)}{r^2}$
	- two mass is different
	- it can be interpreted m is smaller mass and M is bigger mass
	- there is gravitational force between two objects, and you can qualify it with the formula
	- only significant if the two masses is quite large
	- r = distance between two objects
	- F = mg -> 9.8
- electric field diagrams
	- ahhhh
- acceleration due to gravity on earths surface gravitational field strength
>[!Warning] rewording it using "gravitational field strength" => 9.8N/kg U WILL LOSE MARKS IF YOU DONT GIVE IT AS THAT. "acceleration due to gravity" 9.8ms^-1
- G = 6.67 x 10^-11 M = 5.97 x 10^24
- satellite: something orbiting another object.
- people gets tripped up by radius: actually using correct radius, convert km to m!
- people tripped up by square!!!!!1
- towards the Earth
- why is the gravity different at equator vs ?
	- centrifugal force of the earth.
	- gravity force is being partially to maintain the precense of centrifugal motion.
- satellite
	- moon around the earth is ?? gravitational force
	- defined as any body with mass that is orbiting another body (also having mass) * where the orbit is stable
- artificial vs natural satellite
	- artifical: international space system, acting as a satellite not from nature
	- moon is natural satellite to earth and so is earth (to sun)
- geosynchronous vs geostationary
	- geostationary
		- around the equator
	- 24h
## KEPLERS 3RD LAW
- HOW TO DERIVE
- WHEN A SATELLITE IS REVOLVING AROUND AN OBJECT
- THE ONLY force that is pulling the satellite towards the earth is the gravitational force.
- satellite has centripetal force and motion
- v^2 = G m/r
	- by cancelling out centripetal force and the other force formula
- relate this formula to period through ..?
- formula (2pi/r)^t
- 1 rev: t=T period seconds
- revise how to derive keplers 3rd law
- GM/4pi^2=r^3/T^2
- Fc = Fg
- equate two formulas
- substitute period for velocity
- practice practice practice
- Calculate orbital radius
	- satellite (h) metres above earth's surface is moving at 6.6 x 10^3 m/s
	- M=5.97\*10^24, G=6.67\*10^-11, r=6.37\*10^6

	- when converting years to days, it is better to convert it to 365.25, ask the teacher tho to be safe
	- apparent weightless is when the Fn= 0

## experiment:
81.5g ball thing being thrown around
50.3 weight without weights
