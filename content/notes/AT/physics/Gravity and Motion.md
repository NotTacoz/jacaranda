## Gravity is Universal
- This implies that all objects attract each other with a force of gravitational attraction.
- This force is dependent on the mass of the objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two objects (known as the inverse square law).
### Gravity Distance Mass Law $$F_{gravity} \propto \frac{m_{1}+m_{2}}{d^2}$$
- Generally:
	- Higher Mass -> Higher Force (2x Mass -> 2x Force)
	- Higher Distance -> Lower Force (2x Distance -> 1/4x Force)
## Law of Universal Gravitation
- Any mass located in close proximity will experience a gravitational force. This force can be calculated as: $$F=\frac{GMm}{r^2}$$
- F = force between two mass (N)
- G = Universal Gravitational Constant $6.67 \times 10^{-11} m^3kg^{-1}s^{-2}$
- M = mass object 1 (kg)
- m = mass object 2 (kg)
- r = the distance between object 1 and 2 (m)

## Gravitational Fields // Effects of Gravity
- Because two objects mutually attract one another (e.g. the force that earth pulls the moon with is same as the force the moon pulls the earth with):
- **it does not matter which mass we call M and which we call m**
### Weight, Apparent Weight, and Weightlessness
- Mass: A measure of amount of matter in an object.
- Weight: A measure of the force of gravity on an object.
- Using Newton's third law, we know that, if a person stands stationary on level ground, they will experience a normal force from the ground equal and opposite to the force of gravity on them. This is their apparent weight.
- $F_{net}=F_{N}+F_{g}=F_{N}+(-F_{g})=F_{N}=F_{net}+F_{g}$
- If an elevator moves downwards, there is a net force pointing towards the ground, therefore the person in the elevator will feel lighter.
>[!note] teacher recommends to draw a diagram in questiosn like this.
- If acceleration downwards is equal to gravity, N = mg - ma = ma - ma = 0. Therefore you would be weightless. This is true for all objects in free fall!
- When in orbit, space station experiences gravitational acceleration of $g = \frac{Gm}{r^2}$. Since i is orbiting in a circle, it must also be accelerating towards centre (centripetal acceleration - 2024 topic)
- If the centripetal acceleration is equal to the gravitational acceleration, there is no normal force, therefore you would be weightless.
