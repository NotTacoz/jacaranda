## Addition
- Vectors can be represented geometrically.
- To find the resulting vector, use the "head to tail method"
## Subtraction
- Vectors can be subtracted by adding the negative of one of the vectors, and then using the addition method.
## Vector Components
- As Shown with concurrent Vectors, two vectors can be summed together to make a resultant vector.
>[!Question] example: A rocket is launched from ground level at an angle of $60\degree$ to the horizontal. If the rocket has a velocity of $20ms^{-1}$, calculate:
>1) the initial horizontal velocity.
>2) the initial vertical velocity

## Similar Triangles
- some triangles are similar idk

## Inclined planes.
- Label all forces are acting on the ball:
	- Rolling motion of the ball down the incline is the result of the sum of these two vectors, so we do not draw the rolling force

## Boom arms
- a boom is a type of crane which uses the tension in a rope combined with thrust provided by an arm to lift objects.

- $F_{\text{tension}}=F_{\text{against gravity}}+F_{\text{into arms}}$
- a crane holds 20kg mass suspended above the ground 20degree between boom.
	- calculate vertical tension on the rope:
	- calculate the tension on the rope:
	- calculate the thrust on the boom:

- consistently practicing with examples and applying different formulas is the biggest difference with year 11 and 12 based on teacher's observation!
