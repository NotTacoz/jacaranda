## Projectile Motion Investigation (-11)
1. (1) Didn't specify the Optimal Angle definition in the Dependent Hypothesis
2. (1) Didn't mention that at h=0m, optimal angle is 45 degrees.
3. (1) Misread value, and calculation was wrong as a result
4. (2) Unable to discuss reliability of student's results.
5. (1) Didn't read estimate, and as a result didn't give the 2s.f. as required.
6. (1) Didn't read the question fully, and as a result didn't give the error bars.
7. (1) In the conclusion for the experiment, didn't talk about the general trend of the graph.
8. (1) Didn't specify the key principle scientific method
9. (2) General vagueness of response resulted in a poor discussion.
	1. e.g. didn't specify the place where friction occurred, and should have more focused on possible problems that impacted the experiment.
		1. possible problems are the variation presented in the spring, or the effect of gravity on the force provided by launcher.
