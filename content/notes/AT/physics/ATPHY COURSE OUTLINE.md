**Task 3:** Semester 1 Exam (May not include transformers and transmission)
## **Wave particle duality and the quantum theory**
1. light exhibits many wave properties; however, it cannot only be modelled as a mechanical wave because it can travel through a vacuum
**Task 4**  Experiment – Laser interferometry
2. a wave model explains a wide range of light-related phenomena, including reflection, refraction, dispersion, diffraction and interference, such as in Young’s double-slit experiment. A transverse wave model is required to explain polarisation
3. electromagnetic waves are transverse waves made up of mutually perpendicular, oscillating electric and magnetic fields
4. oscillating charges produce electromagnetic waves of the same frequency as the oscillation; electromagnetic waves cause charges to oscillate at the frequency of the wave
5. atomic phenomena and the interaction of light with matter indicate that states of matter and energy are quantised into discrete values
6. on the atomic level, electromagnetic radiation is emitted or absorbed in discrete packets called photons. The energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency. The constant of proportionality, Planck’s constant, can be determined experimentally using the photoelectric effect and the threshold voltage of coloured LEDs

10. on the atomic level, energy and matter exhibit the characteristics of both waves and particles. Young’s double slit experiment is explained with a wave model but produces the same interference and diffraction patterns when one photon at a time or one electron at a time are passed through the slits
*This includes applying the relationship:*

## **Special relativity**
1. observations of objects travelling at very high speeds cannot be explained by Newtonian physics. These include the dilated half-life of high-speed muons created in the upper atmosphere, and the momentum of high-speed particles in particle accelerators
2. Einstein’s special theory of relativity predicts significantly different results to those of Newtonian physics for velocities approaching the speed of light
3. the special theory of relativity is based on two postulates: that the speed of light in a vacuum is an absolute constant, and that all inertial reference frames are equivalent
4. motion can only be measured relative to an observer; length and time are relative quantities that depend on the observer’s frame of reference
_This includes applying the relationships_

11. mass-energy equivalence and the motion of high energy particles in accelerators can be used to test theories of particle physics, including the Standard Model
12. baryons and mesons are hadrons, which are composite particles made up of quarks
13. the Standard Model is based on the premise that all matter in the universe is made up from elementary matter particles called quarks and leptons and their corresponding antiparticles. Fundamental particles interact via the four fundamental forces
14. the Standard Model explains three of the four fundamental forces (strong, weak and electromagnetic forces) in terms of an exchange of force-carrying particles called gauge bosons; each force is mediated by a different type of gauge boson
15. lepton number, baryon number and electric charge are quantities that are conserved in all interactions between particles; these conservation laws can be used to support or invalidate proposed reactions
