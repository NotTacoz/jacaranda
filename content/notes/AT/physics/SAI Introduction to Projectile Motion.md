## significant figure rules
1. always give answers to 3 significant figures.
2. always provide a direction and the appropriate units.
3. for estimates: answers are to 2 significant figures ONLY
4. always provide a diagram.

## what is a projectile
- a projectile is any-body that is given an initial velocity and then follows a path determined entirely by the effects of gravitational acceleration and air resistance.
- **trajectory:** the path followed by a projectile is called its trajectory.
- range: the range refers to the total horizontal distance covered by the projectile from its initial launch till its landing.
## range
- range is the horizontal distance a projectile can travel.

## free body diagrams with air resistance
- its goofy
- the air resistance -> is opposite the direction of motion.
- at maximum height it is <-
