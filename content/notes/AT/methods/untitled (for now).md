## Differentiation (review)
- [[notes/AE/methods/differentiation|differentiation]]
- second derivative test. f''(x)=$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$

## The Product Rule
- The product rules allows you to determine the derivative of the **product of functions** as follows: $$\text{If } f(x)g(x)\text{, then }y'=g(x)f'(x)+f(x)g'(x)$$
- Alternative using Leibniz notation: $$\text{If }y=uv\text{, then } \frac{dy}{dx}= v \frac{du}{dx} + u \frac{dv}{dx}$$
