## Differentiation (review)
- [[notes/AE/methods/differentiation|differentiation]]
- second derivative test. $f''(x)=\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$

## The Product Rule
- The product rules allows you to determine the derivative of the **product of functions** as follows: $$\text{If } f(x)g(x)\text{, then }y'=g(x)f'(x)+f(x)g'(x)$$
- Alternative using Leibniz notation: $$\text{If }y=uv\text{, then } \frac{dy}{dx}= v \frac{du}{dx} + u \frac{dv}{dx}$$
## Quotient Rule
- Let $y=\frac{u}{v}$, the differentiation of $y$ $\frac{dy}{dx}$ is $=\frac{{vu'-uv'}}{v^2}$

## The Chain Rule
- If $y=f(g(x)\text{, the derivative } \frac{dy}{dx} \text{ can be expressed as }f'(g(x))g'(x)$
- If $y=(u)^n$, the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ can be expressed as $n\times(u)^{n-1}\times u'$

## Rates of Change
- Differentiation can be used to solve problems involving rate of change.
	- Important to know:
		- quantity you are differentiating
		- quantity you are differentiating with respect to,
	- t <= 10
	- 4/3\*pi\*(10-t)^3
	- -4\*pi\*(10-t)^2
