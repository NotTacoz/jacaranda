## Horizontal Circular Motion
![[notes/images/Pasted image 20240205121956.png|300]]
- If the speed and direction is constant, there is no *unbalanced* force acting on it.
	- thus it won't accelerate
	- if you change direction, by definition, your velocity is no longer constant, thus you are accelerating.
- 3 ways to be perfectly horizontal with the pendulum.
	- ball on the string with wings?
	- if the object is massless, then string is massless
- direction: towards centre of circular motion
	- Fc = Centrifugal force
	- Fa = Centrifugal acceleration
>[!note] vector quantities **must** have direction: <u>always</u> towards centre of circular motion

- Centripetal = "centre-seeking"
- Centrifugal force is not a force: mention it and you get put in the vacuum chamber
	- One or more real forces must supply the centripetal force. the Fc is sometimes net or a resultant force. i.e. definitely not real!
## Real forces
- gravity
- Friction: sideways friction between tyres and road on roundabout.
- tension: in both direction at all points. typically in high school physics, you say along the rope (usually you get away with that), direction towards the point of attachment

>[!Warning] You will lose marks if you put in non-real forces (centrifugal forces) in a free-body diagram. If you are itching to... use dotted lines...

## Electrical/Magnetic
- ???

## Reaction Force/Normal Force
- Force pushing you forward
