## complex numbers
for any [[notes/imaginary numbers|imaginary numbers]] $bi$, $$(bi)^2=-b^2$$
now allow addition and subtraction of imaginary numbers $bi$ and real numbers $a$:

e.g. $$2+3i$$$$-6 + 1.5i$$ $$2-\frac{9}{7}i$$
each of these expressions are unable to be written more simply, so they are called **complex numbers.** ($a+bi$ where and and b are both real)

the word 'complex' here means 'having more than one part'

for a complex number $z=a+bi$

a = Re(z), the real part of z (Re is getting the real part of the number z)
b = Im(z), the imaginary part of z (Im is getting the imaginary part of the z)

THE IMAGINARY PART OF A COMPLEX NUMBER IS A REAL NUMBER????????!!!!!!!!!!! SHOCKING
there are mathematical reasons for this definition, but its unfortunate it is just defined this way :(

>[!example] e.g. if $z=\frac{1}{2}-6i$ then $Re(z)=\frac{1}{2}$ and $Re(z)=-6$

this is applicant in the [[notes/solutions of quadratic equations|solutions of quadratic equations]]

## arithmetic with complex numbers
for +, -:
treat $i$ just like a variable. $$(2+i)+(6-4i)$$$$=2+6+i-4i=8-3i$$
