- things i need to revise for before friday's trig, matrices, proof by inductrion test

## review:
### pmod 2020 test 3 matrices and trig
- [x] 2.2.3 matrices,Â  
- [x] 2.1.7 general solution, 
- [x] 2.1.4 graphing sec functions, 
- [x] 2.2.3, 2.1.3 - matrix solving (see question 3), ask dr pearce about it!
	- [x] ![[notes/images/Screen Shot 2023-09-18 at 7.17.37 pm.png]] wait nvm i got it basically the range is given in the question ! :p
- [x] 2.1.3 2.1.5 - trig proof, matrix anticlockwise rotation
## old
### general
- [x] plus and minus when squaring :(
### trig
- [x] cosine form = acos(b(x-c)) + d, 
- [x] factorising notice when you should, 
- [ ] CAST error, 
- [x] sum to product, 
- [x] product to sum, 
- [x] finding function of a sine + cosine function, sine + sine, cosine + cosine etc
	- [ ] cambridge assumes there is no phase shift, how do you calculate if there is phase shift? (low priority, probably not on the test)
- [ ] graphing tan, transforming tan
- [ ] graphing cosec, sec, transforming cosec sec etc
- [ ] factor theorem (low priority might not be in the test)
### matrices
- [ ] using matrices to solve for intersection
