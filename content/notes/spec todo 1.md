- things i need to revise for before friday's trig, matrices, proof by inductrion test
## general
- [x] plus and minus when squaring :(
## trig
- [x] cosine form = acos(b(x-c)) + d, 
- [x] factorising notice when you should, 
- [ ] CAST error, 
- [x] sum to product, 
- [x] product to sum, 
- [x] finding function of a sine + cosine function, sine + sine, cosine + cosine etc
	- [ ] cambridge assumes there is no phase shift, how do you calculate if there is phase shift? (low priority, probably not on the test)
- [ ] graphing tan, transforming tan
- [ ] graphing cosec, sec, transforming cosec sec etc
- [ ] factor theorem (low priority might not be in the test)
## matrices
- [ ] using matrices to solve for intersection
