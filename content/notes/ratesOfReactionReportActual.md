## Rates of Reaction: Effect of changing concentration

![200](file:////Users/thomas/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image001.png)

### Background Research

In the experiment, we will be finding the relationship between the concentration of acid and the rate of reaction. Specifically, the relationship of concentration and effect on rate of reaction in an acid neutralisation reaction between hydrochloric acid and calcium carbonate.

To identify the relationship between concentration of acid and rate of reaction, we need to have a look at collision theory. The theory states that, for a chemical reaction to occur:

1.     The reacting molecules must collide with one another.

2.     The collisions must occur with enough energy to disrupt the bonds in the reactants (known as activation energy – ![](file:////Users/thomas/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image003.png)).

3.     The molecules must collide with the correct orientation.

This combined with the Kinetic Theory helps us draw the relationship between concentration of acid and rate of reaction. The theory states that all matter is composed of small particles, which is always in constant motion.

Concentration measures the number of particles in a certain volume of a solution. When concentration increases, there will be a greater number of reactant particles in each volume. According to the Kinetic Theory, the constant motion of atom will lead to an increased number of collisions between particles. As a result, this will increase the frequency of collisions of reactants between a given time. Although the percentage of collisions that are successful (requirements 2 and 3) are the same, higher frequency of collisions will lead into an increased number of **successful collisions**, which increases the **rate of reaction**.

When hydrochloric acid encounters calcium carbonate calcium carbonate, water and carbon dioxide are formed. This is shown in the following net ionic equation for the reaction we will be performing.

### Aim

Use collision theory to explain the effect of changing concentration on the rate of reaction.

### Hypothesis

If the concentration of the reactant, hydrochloric acid is increased, the rate of reaction will increase.
