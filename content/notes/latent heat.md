## energy & change of state
- if water is heated -> temperatures will rise.
- if enough energy is transferred to the water, the water will boil.
- **latent energy** is the energy released or absorbed during a change of state (e.g. when water is boiled, when water is frozen etc etc)
	- latent means hidden/unseen. latent heat is present, but we just do not see it.
- when a substance changes state, temperature remains constant

- temperature is added at a constant rate, but there are sections where temperature remains unchanged while the material change states.
## latent heat
- the energy needed to change the state of a substance is called **latent heat**
- latent heat is calculated using the equation: $$Q=mL$$
- where Q is the heat energy transferred in joules (J)
- m is the mass in kilograms (kg)
- L is the latent heat (Jkg^-1)
### latent heat of fusion (melting)
- as thermal energy is transferred to a solid, temperature of solid increases. 
	- particles within solid gain internal energy (as mostly kinetic energy and some potential energy) and speed of vibration increases
	- internal energy: sum of potential and kinetic energy in substance.
- at the point solid begins to melt, the particles move further apart, reducing the strength of the bonds holding them in place.
	- instead of increasing temperature, the extra energy increases the potential energy of the particles, reducing the interparticle or intermolecular forces.
- tldr: no change in temeprature occurs, as all the extra energy supplied is used in reducing forces between particles.
- amount required to melt solid = potential energy released when liquid reforms into a solid. it is termed **latent heat of fusion**
- for a given substance:
	- heat energy transferred = mass of substance x specific latent heat of fusion
	- $Q=mL_{\text{fusion}}$
	- where Q is the heat energy transferred in joules (J)
	- m is the mass in kilograms (kg)
	- $L_{\text{fusion}}$ is the latent heat of fusion in $Jkg^{-1}$
	- 80 times as much energy to turn 1kg of ice into water (no temp change), as it does to raise temperature of 1kg of water by 1degC.
	- it takes a lot more energy to overcome large intermolecular forces within ice than it does to simply add kinetic energy in raising the temperature.

- latent heat vaporisation $Q = mL_{vapour}$ (boiling)
- average kinetic energy decrease as higher kinetic energy particles will have equipped the liquid.
- dependent on the volatility of the liquid, the surface area, the temperature, the humidity, and the air movement.
