## changing temperature  
 $\therefore$ heat required to raise temp is proportional to the mass.  
    - cooking food somewhere thinking it is an okay temperature and then biting burning your tongue because the inside is hotter than the outside.  
        - $\Delta Q \propto m$  
    - the more heat that is in transferred, the more temp of that substance increases $\therefore$ amount of energy transferred is proportional to change in T  
        - $\Delta \propto \Delta T$  
    - heating the same masses of different materials will show that the amount of energy required to heat a given mass of material through temp change depend on the type/nature of material  
- the specific heat capacity of a material, c , is the amount of energy that must be transferred to change the temp of 1kg of material by $1\degree C$ or $1K$.  
    - $Q=mc \Delta T$  
    - where Q is heat energy transferred (J)  
    - m is mass (kg)  
    - $\Delta T$ change in temp $\degree C \text{ or } K$  
    - $c$ specific heat capacity $Jkg^{-1}K^{-1}$  
- understand formula -> important for things like engineering.  
- must convert units!!!!! teacher notice that rearranging the equation needs to be careful. if you are unsure, do it step by step - probably better so that you know it is right (unless you are certain since it is an easy equation)  
  
### practice question  
- a hot water tank contains 135L of water. Initially, the water is at 20deg C. Calculate the amount of energy that must be transferred to the water to raise the temp to 70 deg  
    - volume = 135L  
    - mass = 135kg  
    - delta T. = final - initial = 50deg C  
    - heat capacity = 4180J/kg/K  
    - put into equation Q = 135 * 4180 * 50 = 28,215,000 J = 2.82 x 10^7  
  
>[!warning] always use the value from the question for heat capacity - if it is not on there, use the data booklet. do NOT ever use values from the internet in a test....  
1.2 specific heat capacity  
- you can see my previous notes at [[notes/archive/AE/PHYSICS/heat|heat]] pls ty  
- small amount of water in a kettle will experience greater change in temperature than a large volume if heated for some time.  
- metal object gets hotter faster than a wooden object.  
- large heaters warm rooms faster than small ones.  
- the significance of these observation is that mass, material, and the amount of energy transferred influence any change of temperature.  
### changing temperature  
- temperature of a substance is measure of the average kinetic energy of particles inside the substance.  
- greater the mass of substance, greater the energy required to change kinetic energy - so heat required to raise temperature by a given amount is proportional to mass of substance.  
### change of state involves separating particles which exert attractive forces on each other; latent heat is the energy required to be added to or removed from a system to change the state of the system This includes applying the relationship Q = m L  
- $Q = m L$  
- L is the latent heat (unique for every substance)  
- Latent heat: energy released/absorbed in the transformation of a state of matter, for a substance  
    - water's latent heat for fusion (conversion between solid and liquid): 3.34×105 J kg−1  
    - water's latent heat for vaporisation (conversion between liquid and gas) - For water: 2.26×106 J kg−1  
>[!note] VAPORISATION (liquid & gas) AND FUSION (solid & liquid) ARE DIFFERENT  
### two systems in contact transfer energy between particles so that eventually the systems reach the same temperature; that is, they are in thermal equilibrium. This may involve changes of state as well as changes in temperature  
- funny property of heat  
- Heat will transfer from a hotter object to a colder one until they reach the same temperature.  
    - the same temperature is NOT THE AVERAGE !!!!!! it depends on the MASS and SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY and ENERGY LOST/GAINED  
    - referring to the  $Q = mc\Delta T$ (specific heat capacity) and  $Q = mL$ (latent heat)  
### a system with thermal energy has the capacity to do mechanical work \[to apply a force over a distance]; when work is done, the internal energy of the system changes  
- what is mechanical work?  
    - measure of the energy transferred by a force.  
    - heat transfer is not considered mechanical work, since there is no measurable force involved in the transfer.  
    - measured in joules (same as heat, and internal energy)  
- mechanical work affect on internal energy:  
    - first law of thermodynamics:  
        - energy can neither be created or destroyed: energy simply changes from one form to another and the total energy in an isolated system remains constant.  
    - internal energy (U) (total internal kinetic and potential energy of the system) of system can be changed by heating or cooling, or by doing **mechanical work** on or by the system.  
    - if **mechanical work** is done **on** the system, internal energy rises and system will **increase** in temperature **or** change state by melting or boiling.  
    - if **mechanical work** is done **by** the system, internal energy decreases and system will **decrease** in temperature **or** change state by condensing or solidifying.  
- mechanical energy to thermal energy.  
    - stirring water -> temperature rises.  
    - same amount of mechanical work ($W=Fs$) always produced exactly the same amount of heating.  
- thermal energy to mechanical energy  
    - system with thermal energy has capacity to do mechanical work.  
        - meaning IT CAN APPLY A FORCE THAT MOVES SOMETHING  
    - through work, energy is transferred from one system to another.  
    - the system doing work will lose internal energy; the system on which work is done will gain **internal energy**  
    - thermal power stations use thermal energy to do work. uses fuel to heat water to steam under high pressure, performing mechanical work on steam turbines, driving electrical generators.  
        - through this process, power station convert heat energy into electrical energy by doing work using thermal energy!.  
### because energy is conserved, the change in internal energy of a system is equal to the energy added by heating, or removed by cooling, plus the work done on or by the system  
- because energy is conserved, the change in internal energy of a system is equal to the energy added by heating, or removed by cooling, plus the work done on or by the system  
### heat transfer occurs between and within systems by conduction, convection and/or radiation  
- heat transfer occurs between and within systems by conduction, convection and/or radiation  
### energy transfers and transformations in mechanical systems always result in some heat loss to the environment, so that the usable energy is reduced and the system cannot be 100 percent efficient This includes applying the relationship efficiency $\text{efficiency (}\eta \text{)}=\frac{\text{energy output}}{\text{energy input}}\times 100\%$  
- energy transformations are never perfect - theres always some energy lost.  ![[notes/images/Pasted image 20231004212521.png]]  
- **efficiency** is percentage of energy that is effectively transformed by a system.  
- the formula $\text{efficiency (}\eta \text{)}=\frac{\text{energy output}}{\text{energy input}}\times 100\%$ ![[notes/images/Pasted image 20231004213149.png]]
