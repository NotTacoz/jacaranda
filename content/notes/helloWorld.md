#navigation 

## what is this? why is this?
- This is the start of a new structuring/hierarchy system for my notes
- Everything will be organised by tags, as I found navigating folders has been way too painful to deal with, I'll see how it goes.
- Github viewers, everything old is in archive; but it doesn't really matter, as externally you can't see the folders anyways.
- TL:DR im wasting too much time on folder parents and children so I am discontinuing that and only exclusively using notes, not creating any folders (daily, images are exceptions, but I might unfolder them too)
	- hopefully my tree will have more functionality and looks nicer :)
- this decision was done on [[notes/daily/2023-09-01|2023-09-01's daily note]]
