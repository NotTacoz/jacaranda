- hydrogenation
	- saturation
	- alkene + h2 -> alkane
- halogenation 
	- alkene + halogen -> alkane with new functional group
	- test for alkene double bond
	- (?) conditions: 
		- kinetic energy i.e. shaking solution
- reaction with hydrogen halide
	- alkene + hydrogen halide -> halo-alkane
- hydration
	- alkene + water -> some sort of alcohol
	- conditions:
		- catalyst
		- high pressure temperature
