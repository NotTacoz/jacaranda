## comprehending structure
- recently, scsa wanted to move away from the thesis sentence as a body paragraph approach, so this structure reflects that:
### structure
#### main body paragraph 1
- thesis
- evidence 1
- explain 1
- evidence 2
- explain 2
- link
#### main body paragraph 2
- topic sentence
- evidence 1
- explain 1
- evidence 2
- explain 2
- link
