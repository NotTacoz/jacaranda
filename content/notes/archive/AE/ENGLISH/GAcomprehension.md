## Question 2: Explain a perspective on growing up offered in Text 2
### 1
- **TOPIC**: Text two offers the perspective that growing up is an experience of greater difficulty for the parent, who is disempowered by the fleeting nature of their role, than for the child who is empowered by the future experiences to come. 
	- reference to text: "text two"
	- "offers"
	- an idea on growing up: an experience of greater difficult for the parent than for the child
		- explained: parent is **disempowered** by the fleeting nature of their role, the child is **empowered** by the future experiences to come.
		- empowered and its antonym.
	- does not talk about language devices - maybe because question didn't ask about it.
- **EVIDENCE 1**: The text's exposition features the event of a father and daughter waiting to cross a busy street, the narrator centralising on the way the father 'grip\[s]' his daughter's hand. 
	- device/metalanguage - "exposition"
	- features - \[scene]
	- "**centralising**" and then quote
	- \[] is used to edit and make the quote make more sense.
- **EXPLAIN 1**: The intensity of the verb choice conveys the desperation of the father to protect his daughter and the text reveals the gesture gives the father the 'certainty that 'she is safe', communicating the father's desire to fulfill his role as a parent in emotionally and physically protecting his child. 
	- **intensity** **conveys** \[idea]: desperation of the father
	- bad use of quotation marks, might be a typo mistake?
- **EVIDENCE 2**: The text continues to delineate the future experiences of the daughter through the anaphora of 'she will'. 
- **EXPLAIN 2**: The high **modality** of the future tense verb connoting the powerlessness of any person who attempts to stop her future, including the father. 
	- apparently **modality** means a word that convey something is likely e.g. "should" "could" "would"
	- in this case, the high modality word is **will**
- **EVIDENCE 3**: The text further reveals in its portrayal of the daughter's future in which she is getting married that her father will have to do the one thing he never really wanted to do and 'let go of her hand', 
	- good quotations, quotations are short but explanations for the quote are longer (blah blah reveals in its portrayal blah blah her father will have to do the one thing), this is nice to tie it into the explanation below
- **EXPLAIN 3**: the inevitability in the **verbial choice** conveys a sense of grief on the father's part. The **anecdotal** tone constructing the daughter's hypothetical future experiences in the elongated sentence structure implies a sense of empowerment in the abundance of experiences she will undertake as a result of growing up.
	- verbial choice is NOT a word, but it is the choice of verbs...
		- use lexical choice or diction
	- **anecdotal** - based on what we see rather than proven facts
- **EVIDENCE 4 + EXPLAIN 4 (?):** The contrast between the nostalgia of the father who in 'letting go' literally and figuratively sacrificing the power he has to protect his daughter and the empowerment of the daughter through the suggestion of inevitable and unique life experiences conveys the bittersweet perspective of the father which is the process of graving up is of greater difficulty for the parent than the child.

structure seems to be thrown out the window in exchange for a more effective analysis of the text, instead of the popular bp1, bp2 structure, author did it all in 1bp
