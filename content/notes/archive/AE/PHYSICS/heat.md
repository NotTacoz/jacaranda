## Science Understanding Heating processes
### the kinetic particle model describes matter as consisting of particles in constant motion, except at absolute zero
- all matter are made up of small particles, particles which are in constant motion, sometimes forming elastic collisions.
- always in motion, except in absolute zero.
### all substances have internal energy due to the motion and separation of their particles
- internal energy refers to the total kinetic and potential energy of particles within substance.
### temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a system
- temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a system
### provided a substance does not change state, its temperature change is proportional to the amount of energy added to or removed from the substance; the constant of proportionality describes the heat capacity of the substance
- This includes applying the relationship
- $Q = mc\Delta T$
- look through [[notes/specificHeatCapacity|specificHeatCapacity]] and [[notes/1.2specificHeatCapacity|1.2specificHeatCapacity]]
### change of state involves separating particles which exert attractive forces on each other; latent heat is the energy required to be added to or removed from a system to change the state of the system This includes applying the relationship Q = m L
- $Q = m L$
- L is the latent heat (unique for every substance)
- Latent heat: energy released/absorbed in the transformation of a state of matter, for a substance
	- water's latent heat for fusion (conversion between solid and liquid): 3.34×105 J kg−1
	- water's latent heat for vaporisation (conversion between liquid and gas) - For water: 2.26×106 J kg−1
>[!note] VAPORISATION (liquid & gas) AND FUSION (solid & liquid) ARE DIFFERENT
### two systems in contact transfer energy between particles so that eventually the systems reach the same temperature; that is, they are in thermal equilibrium. This may involve changes of state as well as changes in temperature
- funny property of heat
- Heat will transfer from a hotter object to a colder one until they reach the same temperature.
	- the same temperature is NOT THE AVERAGE !!!!!! it depends on the MASS and SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY and ENERGY LOST/GAINED
	- referring to the  $Q = mc\Delta T$ (specific heat capacity) and  $Q = mL$ (latent heat)
### a system with thermal energy has the capacity to do mechanical work \[to apply a force over a distance]; when work is done, the internal energy of the system changes
- what is mechanical work?
	- measure of the energy transferred by a force.
	- heat transfer is not considered mechanical work, since there is no measurable force involved in the transfer.
	- measured in joules (same as heat, and internal energy)
- mechanical work affect on internal energy:
	- first law of thermodynamics:
		- energy can neither be created or destroyed: energy simply changes from one form to another and the total energy in an isolated system remains constant.
	- internal energy (U) (total internal kinetic and potential energy of the system) of system can be changed by heating or cooling, or by doing **mechanical work** on or by the system.
	- if **mechanical work** is done **on** the system, internal energy rises and system will **increase** in temperature **or** change state by melting or boiling. 
	- if **mechanical work** is done **by** the system, internal energy decreases and system will **decrease** in temperature **or** change state by condensing or solidifying.
- mechanical energy to thermal energy.
	- stirring water -> temperature rises.
	- same amount of mechanical work ($W=Fs$) always produced exactly the same amount of heating.
- thermal energy to mechanical energy
	- system with thermal energy has capacity to do mechanical work.
		- meaning IT CAN APPLY A FORCE THAT MOVES SOMETHING
	- through work, energy is transferred from one system to another. 
	- the system doing work will lose internal energy; the system on which work is done will gain **internal energy**
	- thermal power stations use thermal energy to do work. uses fuel to heat water to steam under high pressure, performing mechanical work on steam turbines, driving electrical generators.
		- through this process, power station convert heat energy into electrical energy by doing work using thermal energy!.
### because energy is conserved, the change in internal energy of a system is equal to the energy added by heating, or removed by cooling, plus the work done on or by the system
### heat transfer occurs between and within systems by conduction, convection and/or radiation
### energy transfers and transformations in mechanical systems always result in some heat loss to the environment, so that the usable energy is reduced and the system cannot be 100 percent efficient This includes applying the relationship efficiency $\eta=\frac{energy.output}{energy.input}\times \frac{100}{1}\%$
- $\eta=\frac{energy.output}{energy.input}\times \frac{100}{1}\%$
- energy transformations are never perfect - theres always some energy lost. sajj ![[notes/images/Pasted image 20231004212521.png]]
