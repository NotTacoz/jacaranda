## Recap - Exact Values in the Unit Circle

To find the trigonometric ratio of any angle:

1. Sketch the angle for visual reference.
2. Identify the reference angle.
3. Identify the quadrant (1-4), and hence the sign () for the ratio in that quadrant (ASTC positive).
4. Express the ratio using the sign from Step 3 and the ratio for the reference angle from Step 2.
