[[notes/ratesOfReactionReportActual|the actual report i report]]

this is for writing a report
- consider collision theory
  - for reactions to happen, particles must collide.
  - not all collisions are successful, because particles ıhave to collide with correct orientation.

## Experiment
### Report
#### Steps
1.     Background Research
1.5. Aim
2.     Hypothesis
3.     IV, DV, CV
4.     Equipment & Chemicals
5.     Diagram
6.     Method

#### Data Processing
- graph

#### Conclusion
- 
#### Evaluation
- **Validity** - Make sure nothing else affects rate of reaction
- **Reliability** - repeat experiment LITERALLY JUST THIS, EXCLUDES OUTLIERS, CALCULATE AVERAGE !!!!!! RHYME IT FOR MS PILLING, SEND EMAIL TO HER, AND IT WILL HELP GENERATIONS OF STUDENTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "What is Reliability"
- **Errors** - **Systematic** errors and **Random** errors - be curious, open stawa open, open pearson book, open lucarelli book. Read all of them
	- systematic
		- loss of gas - gas is lost immediately, human reaction time is not fast enough to put it on immediately ;-; (not me my valorant 2ms reaction time is fast enough to do it)
			- this reduces volume of carbon dioxide collected
		- use gas syringe :)
	- random
		- surface area of marble chips
