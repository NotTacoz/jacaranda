## empirical formula ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
more likely other schools won't do this calculation. BECAUSE IT IS YEAR 12!!!!!! typical question 100% will be there (pilling seal of guarantee)
### example q
- mass of h2o = 12.9 g
- mass of co2 = 31.4 g
what to do!?
- calculate number of moles of water
- determine number of moles of hydrogen atoms by multiplying moles of h2o by 2
- calculate the number of moles of co2
- determine moles of carbon atoms (moles of carbon atoms = moles of co2)
