verb stem | 方 -> "the way of VERBING" or "how to VERB"

- 方 can be read as かた in some contexts or mostly ほう.
- new word you have created is **NOT** a verb anymore.
  - you cannot use を before a ~方 word.
- し方 for formal and やり方 for informal ways of saying "how to do".
- 仕方ない stems from this meaning "it can't be helped" / "there's no other way."
