# Electronic Configuration
## Sub-shells
- Shells are divided into sub-shells
- Sub-shells are called s, p, d, f (dont need to know names *sharp, principal, diffuse, fundamental*)
	- 's' sub-shell: 2 electrons. (group 1-2)
	- 'p' sub-shell: 6 electrons. (group 13-18)
	- 'd' sub-shell: 10 electrons (group 3-12)
	- 'f' sub-shell: 14 electrons (bottom stuff)
- For principal quantum shells
	- n=1: 1s
	- n=2: 2s2p
	- n=3: 3s3p4s3d
	- n=4: 4s4p4d4f
### Order of filling of sub-shells
- The rule for filling sub-shells with electrons is to start with the lowest energy available sub-shell.
- The sub-shells can be seen below in increasing oder of energy.$$_1H = 1s^1$$
- 36 2, 8, 18, 8
$$1s^22s^2p^63s^23p^64s^23d^{10}4d^6$$
#### Practice
1. 11Na = 2, 8, 1 = 1s2, 2s2 2p6, 3s1
2. 16S = 2, 8, 6 = 1s2, 2s2 2p6, 3s2 3p4
3. 19K = 2, 8, 8, 1 = 1s2, 2s
4. 26Fe = 2, 8, 14, 2 = 1s2, 2s2 2p6, 3s2 3p6 3d6, 4s2
5. 36Kr = 2, 8, 18, 8 = = 1s2, 2s2 2p6, 3s2 3p6 3d10, 4s2 4p6
6. 33As3- = 36As = 2, 8, 18, 8 = 1s2, 2s2 2p6, 3s2 3p6 3d10, 4s2 4p6
7. 38Sr2+ = 36Sr = 2, 8, 18, 8 = 1s2, 2s2 2p6, 3s2 3p6 3d10, 4s2 4p6

- each subshell is made of orbitals
- an orbital is a region around the nucleus of an atom that can hold up to two electrons with opposite spins.
	- electrons have spin in opposite directions to stop repulsion.
	- s orbital is a sphere O
	- p orbital is like an 8
	- 2 electrons maximum, regardless of its orbital
	- d orbital is like a silly shape

idk watch this or smth to revise https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzmL6kktPRY&ab_channel=GradefruitAcademy
(do we even need to know this? (no) )
