## Voice
there **may be** a question on voice
- refers to the persona we 'hear' communicating with us as we engage with a text.
	- e.g. a voice can be:
		- authoritative, credible, knowledgeable
		- urgent, direct, formal
		- emotional - appealing to the audience's emotions
		- humorous, self deprecating
		- colloquial, conversational
		- reflective, nostalgic
		- shady, unreliable
		- cynical
- how voices are constructed
