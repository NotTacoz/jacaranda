# values and attitudes
- values and attitudes are embedded in texts (visual, written and multimodal texts)
- values are what individuals or groups think are important and hold to be worth (e.g. justice, honesty, education)
- dominant values are those values that are widely shared among a group, community, or culture in a particular context.
- attitudesÂ are the positions held or responses an individual or group make, as a result of their values. (For example, when honesty and justice are valued, then an attitude towards stealing might be that anyone who steals should be sent to prison)
