today i started the daily taco

this is where i will note down interesting things that happened in my day, things im interested in, and various observations i make

technology is amazing.

but why, why am i making these notes?

simply put: procrastination, or my desire to deal with it.

i hope i can come with a solution to this procrastination, and deal with it by using the time im not in the mood to write out these daily thoughts. idk if that made sense. idrc.

topics i want to talk abt in the future:
- my opinion on ai art
- how to read more
- reaching the flow state

yeah thats it for today 

ill like update links n stuff once i write abt it maybe
also im not sure if this is gonna be a daily thing. just my random thoughts and ideas lol
