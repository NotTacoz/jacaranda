## recap: direct proportion

- two quantities vary proportionately if one is **always** a **constant multiple** of the other.
- something something more goes here

## inverse proportion

- two quantities are **inversely** proportionate if one is always a constant multiple of **the inverse** of the other.
  - e.g. if you travel 72km at a constant speed, then your travel time (t hours) is inversely proportional to your speed ($v$ km/h), since t is always 72 times the inverse of $v$ (i.e. $t=\frac{72}{v}$
  - "y is proportional to $\frac{1}{x}$" can be written as: $$y\propto \frac{1}{x}$$
  - this can then be written as an equation as follows: $$y=\frac{k}{x}$$
  - where k is the **constant of proportionality**.
- From the equation, you can observe the following:
  - as x increases, y decreases (if k is positive), but not at a constant rate (i.e. not a straight line)
  - the constant of proportionality can be found as follows: $$k=xy$$
  - this can also be used as a test - if xy is constant for all (x,y), then x and y are inversely proportional.

### graphing inverse proportion

- in an inversely proportional relationship:
  - the graph of y against x is a curve called a hyperbola.
  - the graph of y against $\frac{1}{x}$ is a straight line with a **gradient k** that approaches the origin (excluded since $\frac{1}{x}\neq 0$)![500](notes/images/Screen%20Shot%202023-03-14%20at%201.43.18%20pm.png)
- more generally, if $y\propto \frac{1}{x^n}$, then:
  - $y=\frac{k}{x^n}$
  - the graph of y against $\frac{1}{x^n}$ is a straight line with a gradient $k$, that approaches the origin (since $\frac{1}{x^n}\neq 0$)

### practice

![500](notes/images/Screen%20Shot%202023-03-14%20at%201.45.02%20pm.png)

- $y\propto \frac{1}{x^2}$
- $y=\frac{k}{x^2}$
- SUB ( 2, 0.1):
  - $0.1=\frac{k}{2^2}$
  - $k=0.4$
- $y=\frac{0.4}{x^2}$
- SUB X = 10
  - $y=\frac{0.4}{100}=0.004$
- SUB Y = 0.001 - $x^2=\frac{0.4}{0.001}=400$ - $x=20$

- $h=\frac{k}{r^2}$
- let $r_{1}=n$
- let $r_{2}=0.75n$
  - $h_{1}=\frac{k}{{r_{1}}^2}=\frac{k}{n^2}$
  - $h_{2}=\frac{k}{{r_{2}}^2}=\frac{k}{(0.75n)^2}$
    - $=\frac{k}{0.5625n^2}=\frac{1}{0.5625}\times \frac{k}{n^2}$
    - $=1.778 \frac{k}{n^2}=1.778h$
    - INCREASE BY 77.8%
- SUB (4.2, 15):
  - $15=\frac{k}{4.2^2}$
  - $k=264.6$
