## recap

- relations
  - one to one
  - many to one
  - one to many

## functions

- what is a function?
  - a function is a relation where each element of the domain maps onto one element of the range.
  - what is considered functions?
    - one-to-one and many-to-one
  - what is not considered functions?
    - one-to-many are not functions
- does {(1,5),(1,1),(7,-2),(-5,-10)} describe a function or a relation (explain why and identify the type of function)
  - an input of 1 maps to an out of of 5 and 1 (1)
  - therefore it is a one-to-many relation (1)
  - therefore it is a relation only
- determine whether the following describe functions or relations.
  - $y=x^2+2$
    - if you rearrange the equation, then $y=\pm \sqrt{ x-2 }$ therefore it is a one-to-many (because of the $\pm$) (1)
    - therefore it is only a relation (not a function) (1)
- what is a vertical line test
  - if a vertical line intersects the graph no0 more than once over the entire domain, then it is a function
  - if it intersects more than once, it is not a functon
- what is a horizontal line test (not needed)
- secret tip to get higher marks
  - be detailed in your explanation
