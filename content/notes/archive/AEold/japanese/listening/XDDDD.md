good afternoon, my name maikawa satoshi. next month i turn 16 years old. i am first year in a school called nishikawa highschool. there are 5 people in my host family host: host dad, host mum. furtheremore, there are two host brother and host sister. host brother james is studying japanese in university and i think is going to japan in the next year summer holidays for around 4 weeks. before going to japan he thinks he wants to be extremely good at japanese, 3 times a week after dinner study japanese together with me. persist to practice conversation learn new grammar. james can read a lot of kanji, but he is bad at japanese, so, i think more practice is good.

moteimasu?
