title: "T1W9L1: intermolecular forces"
---

intermolecular forces: forces between molecules.
Cl2H2, H2O, CO2, C2H6O, CH3COOH, C24H50 (wax), C6H12O6 (glucose), proteins are molecules. these are sorted by state (gases, liquids, solids)

- properties of covalent compounds
  - boiling point is relatively high.
    - the bottom line though is we cannot say all covalent compounds are gases/liquids/solids, because it depends.
  - some properties are consistent, like electro conductivity
    - covalent bonds are not good at electro conductivity
- make allotropes part of ur vocabulary
  - diff physical form of the same element: diamond, graphite etc
- all forces between molecules can be separated into three
  - one is dispersion forces (van der waals forces / london forces)
    - temporary fluctuating dipole induced dipole interaction. (?wtf)
    - not a very strong intermolecular force
      - cos its always switching !!!
      - so very weak forces of attraction
  - second is permanent dipole-dipole
  - third and strongest is hydrogen bonding
