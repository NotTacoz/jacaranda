title: "T1W9L2: permanent dipole-dipole"
---

we did empirical formula calculation and intermolecular forces
- revise dispersion forces (weakest intermolecular forces)
- hydrogen bonding (oh no) (strongest) (extreme case of permanent dipole-dipole)
- talk about similar size molecules
- permanent dipole-dipole (not as weak as dispersion, and not as strong as permanent dipole-dipole, where we are)

## permanent dipole-dipole
### electronegativity and permanent dipole-dipole
- ability of an atom to attract the bonding pair of electrons in the covalent bond.
- delta +, delta -
- H-Cl
- H-Br
- blah blah blah
- but only look at H-Cl for now
- H-Cl is only hydrochloric acid when solution. it is hydrogen chloride
- $^{\delta+}H-C^{\delta_{-}}\mid\mid\mid\mid\mid\mid\mid\mid^{\delta+}H-C^{\delta_{-}}$
