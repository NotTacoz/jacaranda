- pure substances have a fixed or constant composition
- cannot be separated by physics means
- well defined physics properties, e.g:
  - melting point
  - boiling point
  - hardness
  - density
  - colour
- have constant chemical properties

## mixtures

- contains two or more diff substances, in proportions that can vary
- properties vary with composition, depend on the identity and amounts of constituents
- properties of individual constituents can be used to separate the mixture

### separating mixtures

- sieving
- filtration (diagram)
  - use to separate heterogeneous mixtures composed of solids and liquids
  - uses a porous barrier to separate the solid from the liquid.
  - smaller particles of liquid passes through leaving the solid in the filter paper
- decanting
  - done to separate **particulates** from a **liquid** by allowing the **solids** to settle to the bottom of the mixture and pouring off the particle-free part of the liquid.
  - another method is to allow two immiscible liquids to separate and the lighter liquid is poured off.
  - separating funnel is better than decanting
- use of separation funnel (diagram)
  - dehydrating agent to remove water
  - something filtered using funnel is called filtrate
- distillation (diagram)
  - you need to be very careful and selective
  - a question might ask for you to choose a method
    - if this is the case, identify if substances is homogenous or heterogenous
  - distillation works for **homogenous**, **LIQUID** homogenous mixtures
  - if it is simple distillation, there must be a **NOTICEABLE** difference in boiling point.
  - eg water and ethanol works for distillation
  - you can use heating mantle instead of bunsen burner

  - you should be able to label this (no need to draw diagram)
  - not incl: water outlet label, distillate label
- fractional distillation (basic diagram)
  - when the boiling point is too close together for normal distillation.
    - more than 2 things to be separated
- electrostatic attraction
- magnetic susceptibility
- vaporisation
- crystallisation
- chromatography
- centrifuging
- evaporating
- dissolving
- sieving
  - a porous material is used to separate particles of different sizes.
  - method is most commonly used to effect gross separations, as of liquids from suspended crystals or other solids.
  - to accelerate filtration, pressure usually is applie.
  - a series of sieves is stacked, with the screen of largest hole size at the top.
- flotation

## homogenous materials

- have uniform compositions throughout
- include all pure substances (elements and compounds) and some mixtures.
- the only kind of mixture that is homogenous is a solution, eg: salt water.

## heterogeneous materials

- materials are non-uniform - you can see differences from one section to another
- the constituents are physically separated, eg: in a different phase
- examples include
  - granite (mixture of mineral grains)
  - milk (fat globules suspended in water)
  - toothpaste (solid particles suspended in liquid)
