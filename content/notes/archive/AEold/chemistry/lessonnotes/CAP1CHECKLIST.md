lil checklist to make sure ive studied everything :)

# task 1: line spectra

This 25 mark task will assess your understanding of the concepts related to Experiment 8 (Flame Tests) and Experiment 9 (Emission Spectra).
As it is a Science Inquiry Skills task, there will be questions related to the experimental aspects of the experiments.
It will also be important to understand the underlying chemistry concepts, particularly atomic absorption and emission spectra.

- [x] revise science inquiry skills
- [ ] how does the experiments impact accuracy and reliability
- [ ] atomic absorption
- [ ] emission spectra

# task 6

- [x] John Dalton
- [x] J.J. Thomson
- [x] Ernest Rutherford
- [x] Niels Bohr
- [x] James Chadwick,
- [x] chronology of the discoveries by the scientists in question â€“ how do they fit together to form a timeline?
- [x] Specific experiments done by the scientists, and how outcomes of these experiments advanced our understanding of the structure of the atom.
- [x] Major discoveries that were made, theories that were developed, and developments to atomic models that were proposed.
- [x] Properties and locations of subatomic particles, and how we use the Periodic Table to establish numbers and arrangements of subatomic particles.
- [ ] Isotopes of elements, their similarities and differences in terms of atomic structure and physical and chemical properties.
