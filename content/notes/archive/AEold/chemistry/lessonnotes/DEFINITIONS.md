- element: chemical substance unable to be broken down into other substances. All its atoms have the same number of protons.
- compound: a substance made from two or more different elements chemically combined together.
- atom: contains particles of protons, neutrons and electrons
- isotope: atoms with the same amount of protons but different amount of neutrons
- molecule: two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds COVALENTLY
  - Not all compounds are molecules - ms pilling e.g. NaCl google different
- ion: atom with a positive or negative charge
  - Elemental ions: ions that are elements
  - Molecular ions: ions that are molecules
  - Complex ions: e.g. [CuCL4]^-2, [Cu(H2O)6]2+
- Chemical symbol: letter or pair of letters used to represent an element
- Relative atomic mass: the mass of the atom relative to the weight of protons and neutrons
- Chemical formulae: shows the reactants taking part in a chemical reaction and the products formed from the reactants IN THE CORRECT PROPORTION
- Chemical equation: symbolic representation of chemical reactions
- Empirical formula: the simplest whole number ratio
- Stoichiometry: the relationship between relative quantities of substances taking part in a chemical reaction
