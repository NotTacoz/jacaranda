title: "chromatography"
---

## what is

- series of analytical techniques that can be used to **separate mixtures of compounds** for further use or for analysis.
- in all forms of **chromatography**, it involves a **mobile phase** moving through across a **stationery phase**
- in paper chromatography, the mobile phase is in solvent in liquid phase, and the stationery phase is the solid (it could be solid) paper, which the liquid travels up to.

### stationery phase

- this phase does not move. compounds in the mixture are attracted to it (**absorbed**) and slowed down. either a solid or a liquid

### mobile phase

- this phase moves. the more soluble compounds in the mixture are carried faster as the mobile phase moves. either a liquid or a gas.

## paper chromatography

- used to separate mixtures, especially dyes or pigments.
- line of origin - where the solvent starts
- solvent front (?) - the distance the solvent travels??? (?)
- **capillary action** is what draws the solvent up the paper.

## what

- less polar substances, the further the substances travels

## thin layer chromatography

- all chromatography involves a stationery phase and a mobile phase.
- in **thin layer chromatography (TLC)**, the stationery phase is a layer of silica gel fixed onto a glass plate.
- the mobile phase is a solvent which travels up the plate, carrying the substance.
- TLC use the same principals as paper chromatography.
- capillary action still draws the solvent up the matrix; however while the molecules in paper chromatography are separated based on mass, in TLC, separation often depends upon solubility or charge, due to the interactions of solute and matrix.
- a dry sample is placed in the silica gel matrix. As the solvent front moves up the gel, it dissolves the sample and carries it up the matrix with it.
- some of the particles in the sample stick more strongly to the silica gel than others, so they lag behind the solvent.
- eventually the different substances in the sample separate out, with similar molecules travelling a similar distance.

### capillary action of TLC

- the solvent (i.e. the mobile phase) is drawn up the stationery phase by capillary action.
- **adhesive forces** are between molecules of different substances. adhesion enables solvent molecules to bond to the stationery phase.
- **cohesive forces** are between molecules o the same substance. Cohesion enables solvent molecules to bond to each other, and pull each other up to the stationery phase.

## advantages and disadvantages of TLC and paper chromatography

advantages of TLC

1. the grass is rigid, not flexible like player, so it is easy to control
2. after separation, the substances in the mixture can be recovered. the silica gel holding the separated substance is scraped off the glass plate and added to a solvent. the substance will dissolve and the silica gel can easily be removed by filtration.
   1. the glass plates can be recoated with silica gel and used over and over again.
3. many substances are white or colourless, and so aren't visible on TLC plate.
4. one way of making colourless substance show up is use UV light. This usually works well for organic compounds.
5. an alternative method is to use a chemical locating agent - a chemical that reacts with the substance to form a coloured compound.
6. for example, when **ninhydrin** is exposed to organic compound, it stains it purple-brown.

## column chromatography

- ????????????????????????????????????????????????

## gas chromatography

- gas chromatography has a stationery phase, depends on how strongly it is attracted/absorbed to the surface.
- gas shouldn't react with any substances in the mixture. non flammable either
