## refer to lesson notes for most of solubility things

## solubility curves

- use of solubility curves to dissolve substances at particular temperature, to make super saturated, saturated and unsaturated solutions.

## mole per litre ($molL^{-1}$)

- what is it?
  - it is a unit for concentration. ie, how much solvent in solute.
- EXAMPLE: what is 1.0 mol/L solution of NaCl?
  - 1 mole of NaCl dissolved n 1L of solution
- what are some other units for concentration:
  - $gL^{-1}$: grams per litre.
  - $ppm$: parts per million.

## concentration

- concentrated or dilute
  - what does this mean?
    - concentrated suggests there is a large mass of solvent, and dilute suggests there is a small mass of solvent dissolved in solute.
- what does concentration refer to?
  - the amount of solute dissolve in the solvent

### unit for concentration

- what are the units for concentration?
  - mass per 100g water
    - (% w/w)
  - volume per 100mL water
    - (% v/v)
  - mass per 100mL water
    - ($ w/v)
  - parts per million
    - (ppm) - mg per kg
  - moles per litre of solution
    - ($molL^{-1}$ or $M$ (in old questions, which may be reused))
    - this is something called molarity
- how do you convert one concentration in to another?
  - v/v % (when solute is a liquid)
    - $\frac{V_{solute}}{V_{solvent}}\times 100\% ml/100ml$
  - m/v % (when solute is a solid)
    - $\frac{m_{solute}}{V_{solvent}}\times 100\% g/100ml$
  - m/m % (when both solute and solvent are solids)
    - $\frac{m_{solute}}{m_{solvent}}\times 100\% g/1g$

### density

- consider mass and volume.
- density of water is 1g/mL
  - iow 1g of water = 1mL
- formula for density: - $p=\frac{m}{V}$
