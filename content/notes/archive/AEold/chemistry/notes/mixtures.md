- solvent, solute, evaporate solvent, and you are left with solute in solid form.
- difference between evaporation and crystallisation is you can't evaporate solvent until dryness.
  - you evaporate to the point of super saturation
- in crystallisation, you cool your supersaturated solution, to produce crystals.
- you can have salt that is thermally unstable.
- issue with ammonium chloride is that it is thermally unstable.
  - you cannot use evaporation process for ammonium chloride (since it is thermally unstable - you have to use **crystallisation**)
- solution is when soluble solute dissolves in solvent
- mixture is when insoluble is mixed with solvent
- filtration
  - use of filter paper that allows water to pass through, but not solids.
- evaporation
  - heat the evaporating dish (which contains solution)
  - this causes the solution to be concentrated, and form crystals
  - relatively quick and easy way
  - problem is that some solids decompose when it is heated.
    - susceptible to thermal decomposition
- crystallisation - slowly heat it - gentle heat it, stop heating it before it fully turns into crystals, and then funnelling it out.
