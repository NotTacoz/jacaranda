## intensity

- objective measure of the rate at which the wave motion carries energy.
- $P=\frac{E}{t} \implies I=\frac{E\div t}{A}\implies I=\frac{E}{At} \implies I=\frac{P}{A}$
- a wave spreads out spherically from a point source. when the distance is doubled, the energy by the wave will spread out over four times the original area.
- the behaviour is thus an inverse square law:
  - $I \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$
  - if the intensity is $I_{0}$ at a particular distance $r_{0}$, then $I_{0}=\frac{1}{{r_{0}}^2}$
    - what??
  - since the proportionality constants are the same, then the ratio of the intensities given as
    - $I_{0}{r_{0}}^2=I_{f}{r_{f}}^2$
  - $L(db)=10\log \frac{I}{I_{0}}$
  - **$\frac{I_{f}}{I_{0}}=\frac{{r_{0}}^2}{{r_{f}}^2}$ worth remembering!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**
