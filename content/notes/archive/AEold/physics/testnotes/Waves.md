## Tube Resonance

(and the wavelength of sound)

- what happens when you blow air on the top of a tube or cylinder
  - it will resonate
- why does blowing the top of a bottle cause it to vibrate.
  - it causes turbulence
- what is the top of the bottle called
  - when an air can move - antinode
  - bottom of bottle is called a node
- what is the length of tube in terms of wavelength
  - $\frac{1}{4}\lambda$
- what about two double ended tubes?
  - two antinodes, one node
- what is the wavelength of double ended tube?
-
