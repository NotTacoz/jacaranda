## linear motion
### science as a human endeavour
- [ ] understand how safety and other road users has been increased through applications of newton's laws and conservation of momentum through helmets, seatbelts, crumple zones, airbags, safety barriers.
- this is a brief summary, and is missing a lot of detail to achieve a high mark. please revisit later.
- seatbelt designed to lock during severe deceleration.
	- as the human has the same motion applied as the car they are moving in, 
	- according to newtons first law, objections in motion stay in motion: when the car stops the human keeps moving forward, and is likely to collide or be flung out.
- airbag minimises injuries
	- if vehicle impacts object at 18-20 km/h or more, airbags inflate.
	- since the body will continue to be in motion, the airbags will help decelerate the body.
- crumple zones + helmets
	- similar principles to airbags
	- helmets have like a crushable foam.
	- crumple zones extend the time for a crash to take place
- traffic safety barriers doesn't entirely slow deceleration, but is good because it can enact an opposing force on the object, and protects people from places such as bridges.
## science understanding
### scalar vs vector quantities
- [ ] describe difference between scalar and vector quantities
- #### scalars
	- values which only require the magnitude (size) and the units.
	- e.g. time is a scalar value, because it does not tell you anything about the position or direction.
- #### vectors
	- values with both magnitude (size) and direction (units ofc as well)
	- examples of vectors include:
		- position
		- displacement
		- velocity
		- acceleration
		- force
		- momentum
	- because they have direction and magnitude
	- u can represent vectors as arrows
	- since arrows have direction and magnitude (length of arrow indicates magnitude and obviously direction of arrow indicates direction)
		- end of arrow is called tail, the other end is called head.
	- vector arrows in one direction is like <-> or up arrow to down arrow lmao
	- sign convention - make sure for one direction arrows (and 2 direction) say like the direction of the arrows too.
	- ##### vectors in two directions
		- horizontal plane (north east south west)
			- you can use true bearing or you can use quadrant bearing
			- iirc quadrant bearing is recommended for physics
			- basically N/SdegreesE/W
				- pretty self explanatory stuff
				- in words you write like from north x degrees towards the east or whatever direction lmao
		- vertical plane (up down left right)
			- ![](notes/images/Screen%20Shot%202023-03-22%20at%206.09.31%20pm.png) i dont really want to describe and say all this shit but u get the idea
	- yeah thats basically it do the review chapter !!!
#### vector addition
- [ ] how to add and subtracts vectors in two dimensions
- sometimes more than one vector can act upon an object (no way wtf?!?!?!)
	- so you need to add vectors
	- and find resultant of the two vectors.
- vectors 3d also exists but not tested ofc
- same dimension vectors are collinear (parallel)
	- so just simplify to + and - and add them together normally
- graphical method
	- use head to tail method
	- join up the tail of 1 vector to the head of another.
- ##### two dimensions 
- head to tail method and parallelogram (not going to be bothered with parallelogram cos basically same method for same results)
- for head to tail like add the head and tail together.
	- get the angle of the shit and use trig (cosine and sine rule)
	- and calculate the hypotenuse of the angles.
	- draw it geometrically if you need help wit it
- subtracting vectors you just get the opposite vector
	- e.g. -30metres west is just 30metres east.
### applications of suvat, and the equations
please refer to my useful notes on [displacement, speed and velocity](notes/archive/AEold/physics/pearson/7.1.md) and [acceleration](notes/archive/AEold/physics/pearson/7.2.md) 
- equations you should know applications for:
$$V_{avg}=\frac{s}{t},a=\frac{v-u}{t},v=u+at,s+ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2,v^2=u^2+2as$$
(in the formula sheet)
### representations, graphs, and equations of motion
#### position time graphs
- basically y-value is position, and x-value is time.
- the gradient of the position-time graph is velocity.
	- therefore, if the graph is like linear, then velocity is constant.
	- furthermore, if the graph is quadratic-like, then velocity is changing.
		- to calculate the non-uniform velocity, the gradient will be the tangent to the point of interest![](notes/images/Screen%20Shot%202023-03-22%20at%206.22.09%20pm.png) (photo attached cos idk how to explain it in words!!)
#### velocity time graphs
- shows how velocity of an object changes over time.
- area of a velocity graph is the displacement.
- gradient of a velocity time graph is the acceleration
- to calculate average acceleration, use $a=\frac{v-u}{t}$
- if gradient is curved and non-uniform (like position time), then acceleration non-linear. if it is uniform and linear, then acceleration is constant.
#### acceleration time graphs 
![](notes/images/Screen%20Shot%202023-03-22%20at%206.24.45%20pm.png)
illustrate the jumps with dotted lines i think is what is recommended
#### uniform acceleration
- when no grah what to do?
- simple: use more precise and faster methods involving constant or uniform acceleration
- use $a=\frac{\delta v}{t}=\frac{v-u}{t}$
	- this can be rearranged to get $v=u+at$
- average velocity is $v_{avg}=\frac{s}{t}$
- since v average is half of the final - initial velocities $v_{avg}=\frac{1}{2}(v+u)$
	- $\frac{s}{t}=\frac{1}{2}(v+u)$
	- $s=\frac{1}{2}(v+u)t$ (whoa an equation of motion, derived from simple formulas)
- we know displacement is the area of a velocity time graph, which can be represented as $s=ut+\frac{1}{2}(v-u)\times t$
	- we also know that $a=\frac{{v-u}}{t}$
	- such $s=ut+\frac{1}{2}\times a\times t\times t=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$
### vertical motion and gravity
- acceleration is 9.80m
- substitute for equations of motion.
- that's it.
### newton's three laws of motion
#### force preface
 force can be thought of as push or pull
- forces that directly act upon a body are called **contact forces**, because the force is only experienced when contact is maintained. 
	- forces acted upon the body at a distance are **non-contact** forces.
- a force is measured in newtons
#### 1. an object in motion stays in motion (maintain constant velocity) unless an unbalanced, external force acts upon it (the object).
- the term **maintains a constant velocity** implies that, if the object is moving, then it will continue to move with a velocity that has the same magnitude and direction. e.g. a car moving 12m/s south after a set amount of time will still be moving at 12m/s (this is also consistent with zero velocity)
- **unless** implies an otherwise for the non-continuation of a constant velocity, and is shown through an **unbalanced** acting force.
- terminal velocity is the state of time when the speed a skydiver falls is equal to the air resistance, such the skydiver is unable to gain acceleration without changing anything such as mass or shape.
- ##### inertia
	- the law is expanded upon with inertia.
	- inertia is considered to be the resistance to a change in motion of an object.
	- as the mass of an object increases, inertia increases.
	- inertia causes:
		- harder to start moving a stationery object.
		- harder to stop moving a object with a velocity.
		- harder to change the direction of motion.
		- this can be demonstrated in real life through shopping carts.
#### 2. force = mass x acceleration
- connects mass, acceleration and forces
- newtons 2nd law can be edited to fit with change in momentum
- since $a=\frac{v-u}{\Delta t},F=m \frac{v-u}{\Delta t}=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$
#### 3. every force has an equal and opposing force.
- when hammer hits nail, the nail and the hammer both experience forces.
	- the force experienced by hammer is relative to the force experienced by the nail.
	- this observation follows newton's third law. stating every force has an equal and opposing force.
- in a collision of a large bus and a small car, the force both experiences are the same.
	- but due to the difference in mass, one has a higher acceleration, whilst the other has a lower acceleration.
- this is true for gravity as well - called the normal force.
	- abbreviated as $F_{N}$ or $N$
### free body diagram  
### applying the relationship F=ma and Fweight=mg using free body diagrams.
## momentum
- p=mv where p is momentum (kgm/s), m is mass of object (kg), v is velocity of object (m/s)
### conservation of momentum (1d collisions)
- $\sum p_{before}=\sum p_{after}$
- or expressed as $m_{1}u_{1} + m_{1}u_{2}=m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{1}$ 
	- blah blah blah yk what each variable means.
	- if the objects colliding joins together then its $m_{1}u_{1}+m_{1}u_{2}=m_{3}v_{3}$
	- if the objects explode and break apart into two objects then it is $m_{1}u_{1}=m_{2}v_{2}+m_{3}v_{3}$
### change in momentum // impulse
- $i=\Delta p=p_{final}-p_{initial}=mv-mu=m(v-u)$ (impulse is change in momentum)
- area of force time graph = momentum change = impulse (since $F=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$)
## energy
### work
- work is a measurement of how much energy to transfers forces
- measured in joules ($\frac{kg\times m^2}{s^2}$), since work is = Fs = ma x s = m x m/s^2 x s
	- since W=Fs, 1J = 1N x 1m = 1Nm
	- 1J = 1N x 1m = 1kgm/s^2 x 1m = 1kgm^2/s^2
### energy conservation
### energy equations
