# hypothesis

- if the weight force of the hanging mass increase, the acceleration of the dynamics trolley increases.

# variables

- ## independent variable
  - the weight force of the hanging mass
- ## dependent variable(s)
  - **acceleration**
  - time
  - final velocity
- ## controlled variables
  - total mass
  - displacement (131cm)
  - initial velocity

# method

materials needed

- dynamics cart
- pulley string
- pulley
- 5 x 50g weights
- hangar
- dynamics track
- computer with correct software installed
  procedure

1. setup a cart on an elevated track such the cart will travel 131cm before coming to a stop due to collision from the sensor.
2. the track elevation should be high enough such the pulley string on cart collision doesn't touch the ground.
3. tie pulley string to the dynamics cart, and tie the other end to a hanger, and place the string on the pulley.
4. start with 5 x 50g weights on the cart, and let go of the cart and record time to collide.
5. repeat process 3 times total
6. move weight from cart to hangar and repeat entire procedure.

# results

# processing results

$\vec{a}=\frac{2s}{t^2}$ and $\vec{a}=\frac{m\vec{g}}{m+M}$
t^2 = 2s/a

uncertainty calculation
displacement measuring uncertainty: 131cm +- 0.1 (0.05\*2 since 2 rulers were used)
time (human timed) measuring uncertainty: x +- 0.005s or x +- 5ms
