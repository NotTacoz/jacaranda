- how quickly velocity changes

## finding change in velocity and change

- velocity and speed change all the time.
- to find the change $\Delta$, initial value is taken away from the final value $$\Delta v=v-u$$

## acceleration

- acceleration is the gain or loss of velocity of an object.
- for example car starting up, accelerates to a certain velocity, and a runner slows down before coming to a stop.
- - is deceleration + is acceleration
- average acceleration formula $$a=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{v-u}{t}$$

## review

1. radio
   1. $\Delta v=v-u$ = -7kmh
2. blu tack
   1. -5ms
3. ping pong
   1. 2ms
4. running north ashley
   1. -7.5/1.5 = decelerating at -5m/s^2 north
5. rocket model
   1. 150km/3.5 42.9km/h^2
6. squash ball
   1.
