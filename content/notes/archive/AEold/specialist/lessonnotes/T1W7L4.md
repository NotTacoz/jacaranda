## positon vectors
- a position vector is a vector used to represent the position of a point (in the cartesian place when working in 2d space) relative to the origin.
- (dont forget that the vector $\vec{O}P$ itself has no fixed position - it just describes the position of P)
### why?
- you can take advantage of it to solve problems in coordinate geometry.
- you cant add coordinates together, but it is something you can do with vectors.
- you can use vector approaches to solve problems within coordinate geometry.
### general rule
$\vec{AB}=\vec{OB}-\vec{OA}$
#### how is it derived
- $\vec{AB}=\vec{OB}+\vec{AO}$
- $\vec{AO=}-\vec{OA}$
be careful the position vector end point is joint to the start point
