## the story so far (like the band)

- any 2d vector can be resolved into a sum of horizontal and vertical components, written as a**i** + b**j** where **i** and **j** are unit vectors.
- i is le horizontal vector | magnitude of 1
- j is le vertical vector | magnitude of 1
- if a horizontal vector has a magnitude of 4, then it will be 4i (what?!)
- pretend theres a vertical vector with magnitude of 6, then it will be 6j?!
  - such 4i + 6j = the vector
- that is essentially component form
- ai + bj can be written as <a, b> or $a \choose b$
- the miracle
  - vectors in component form can be added by adding their components and simplifying (WHAT?!): $$ai+bj+ci+dj=(a+c)i+(b+d)j$$
  - incredible stuff
- vectors must undergo conversion
- questions may need your answer in magnitude and direction form, shown as followed:
  - magnitude and direction -> component form -> magnitude and direction.
  - therefore it is an important skill to convert

### conversion

- write the following vector in component form vector
- use trig
- u = ai + bj
- cos(4) = a/5
  - a = 5cos40
- sin(40) = b/5
  - b = 5sin40
- u = 5cos40i + 5sin40j
  - = 3.83i + 3.21j
- a vector v can be written in component form as $$v=|v|\cos \theta i+|v|\sin \theta j$$
- where 0 is the angle of the vector measured anti-clockwise from east $$\vec{V}=|\vec{V}|\cos \theta i+|\vec{v}|\sin \theta j$$
- put negative sign on the corresponding thingy if it is not facing up and not facing right.

### idk what to title this something something equilibrium

- find $p$ and $\theta$ if the forces below are in equilibrium.
- the sum of the forces is the zero vector $0i+0j$
- vector equation
  - $25i-50j+ai+bj=0i+0j$
  - $25i+ai+0i$ and $-50j+bj=0j$
  - $25+a=0$ and $-50+b =0$
  - $a=-25$ $b=50$
