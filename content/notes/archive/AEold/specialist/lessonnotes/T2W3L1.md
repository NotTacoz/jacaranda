## theorem 8

- if AB and CD of a circle that cut at a point P (which may be inside or outside the circle), then PA x PB = PC x PD.
- case 1: the intersection point P is inside the circle.
- consider triangles APC and DPB
  - $\angle{APC}=\angle{DPB}$ (vertically opposite)
  - $\angle{CAB}=\angle{BDC}$ (angles in the same segment)
- thus triangle APC is similar to triangle DPB (AAA). This gives: - $\frac{PA}{PD}=\frac{PC}{PB}$ - $\therefore PA\cdot PB=PC\cdot PD$
  points are not labeled properly lmao

## theorem 9

- consider triangles PAT and PTB
  - $\angle{ATP}=\angle{TBA}$ (alternate segment theorem)
  - $\angle{PAT}=\angle{PTB}$ (angle sum of a triangle)
- Therefore triangle PAT is similar to triangle PTB. (AA)
- This gives= - $\frac{PA}{PT}=\frac{PT}{PB}$ - $\therefore PT^2 = PA\cdot PB$
  points are not labeled properly lmao

  page 140 contains useful summaries of theorems you are expected to know
  you do not need to know how to prove unless a question asks for you to explain it (which may be a possibility)
