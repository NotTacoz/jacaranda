- evidence is not just recounting plot points or retelling what happens. textual evidence needs to be discussed in terms of scenes and using film language (meta language - e.g. body language, dialogue, facial expressions.)
- how is the director positioning the audience through Kya. Kya is a character, she is not purposefully doing anything she has been created that way.
- reference or understand the form of the text. the audience is not a reader, it is a film. use a viewer or responder or audience. Film's have a director or screen writer, not an author.
- when referencing quotes, discuss is it Kya's voice over narration or dialogue.
- link global sentences to your reference the text sentences. e.g. "this is evident in 'where the crawdads sing'...."
