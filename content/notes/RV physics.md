## heat processes
### Science as a Human Endeavour:
- The development of heating technologies that use conduction, convection, radiation and latent heat have had, and continue to have, significant social, economic and environmental impacts. These technologies include:
#### passive solar design for heating and cooling of buildings
- energy costs rise, resources dwindling -> need to reduce amount of fossil fuels used to provide energy for stuff.
- reduce energy through passive heating of a building through solar design.
- **insulation** prevents loss of **conduction** in winter and gain of heat by conduction in summer.
	- conduction process of which heat energy is transmitted through collisions between neighbouring atoms/molecules.
- **large windows** on northern side of house allows solar energy to warm interior in winter. **small windows** in the south provide ventilation but reduce heat loss on the shady side of the house.
- **overhanging eaves/deciduous trees** provide shade in summer.
- **blank walls** heavily shaded by trees/overhangs avoid sun of hot summer and shield against prevailing winter wind.
- living areas on the northern side allows winter sun to warm areas of house where it is needed during the day, and rooms used little are sited on the southern side of the house.
- heavy curtains/double glazing reduce conductive heat loss at night and winter. also reduce solar energy gains in summer. conventional single glazing allows heat to be lost through conduction (?)
#### the development of the refrigerator over time
#### the use of the sun for heating water
#### engine cooling systems in cars
### science understanding
#### the [[notes/kinetic particle model|kinetic particle model]] describes matter as consisting of particles in constant motion, except at [[notes/absolute zero|absolute zero]]
- kinetic particle model assumes for all states of matter that:
	- all matter is made up of many very small particles (atoms or molecules)
	- the particles are in constant motion.
	- overall, no kinetic energy is lost/gained during elastic collisions between particles.
	- there exists forces of attraction and repulsion between particles in a material.
	- the distance particles in a gas are large compared with the size of the particles
- particle velocity/movement is dependent on temperature, as temperature increases, average velocity of particles increase and vice versa. the coldest possible temperature, where particles stop moving is called [[notes/absolute zero|absolute zero]]
#### all substances have internal energy due to the motion and separation of their particles
- all substances have internal energy due to the motion and separation of their particles
- **kinetic energy** is the energy of movement.
- **potential energy** is the energy stored in the bonds between particles.
- kinetic particle model explain idea of heat as a transfer of energy.
- **heat** is the transfer of **thermal energy** from a hotter body to a cold one.
- **thermal energy** refers to the energy contained within a system responsible for its temperature.
- internal energy is the **total kinetic energy** and **potential energy** within a substance.
- heating is the process of transferring thermal energy.
- heating changes the internal energy of a substance by affecting the kinetic energy and/or potential energy of particles within the substance.
- energy is a measure of an object's ability to do **work**
	- e.g. raising an objects temperature is doing work.
	- measured in joules (J)
- the internal energy of a system is defined as the kinetic and potential energy of the system.
- if heating results only in the change of state or expansion of object, and not a change in temperature, does the total internal energy increase?
	- yes. potential energy increases, not the kinetic energy!
#### temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a system
#### two systems in contact transfer energy between particles so that eventually the systems reach the same temperature; that is, they are in thermal equilibrium. This may involve changes of state as well as changes in temperature
#### a system with thermal energy has the capacity to do mechanical work (to apply a force over a distance); when work is done, the internal energy of the system changes
#### because energy is conserved, the change in internal energy of a system is equal to the energy added by heating, or removed by cooling, plus the work done on or by the system
#### heat transfer occurs between and within systems by conduction, convection and/or radiation
### calculations
#### provided a substance does not change state, its temperature change is proportional to the amount of energy added to or removed from the substance; the constant of proportionality describes the heat capacity of the substance
- This includes applying the relationship: $$Q=mc\Delta T$$
#### change of state involves separating particles which exert attractive forces on each other; latent heat is the energy required to be added to or removed from a system to change the state of the system
- this includes applying the relationship: $$Q=mL$$
#### energy transfers and transformations in mechanical systems always result in some heat loss to the environment, so that the usable energy is reduced and the system cannot be 100 percent efficient
- this includes applying the relationship: $$\text{efficiency } \eta=\frac{\text{energy output}}{\text{ energy input}}\times \frac{100}{1}\%$$
