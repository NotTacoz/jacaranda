received my draft back marked, and I am taking notes of things I should improve on/I did wrong:
- (FIXED) space for thesis is not needed
- ask why after every sentence to yourself, and answer it in the response, I had the tendency in the draft to not explain in depth (responding also had this issue)
- what is the effect of this? 
	- add linking sentences between evidence and explanation - e.g. this is significant in
- when analysing visual texts, need to be explicit about what medium that the text is in e.g. a cartoon, a realistic photo / whatever. if it is a cartoon, the artistic interpretation is significant, and a lot is different compared to a real photo.
- talk about context and assume that the reader lives under a rock and hasn't read the text you have read. pretend that they are reading the analysis STANDALONE without having read what you have read.
