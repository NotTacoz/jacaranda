## Weekly Review
- Hello, this is my weekly review
- This week is a 2/10
- Specialist: Disappointed with my score, I am trying my heart out on functions and when the investigation releases, I will pour my heart to studying that too. Current Review of Functions I find it difficult, but hopefully I grasp it quickly.
- Methods: Not much to say. Disappointed as I lost all my marks in the worst reading and arithmetic mistake. I don't think my sleep schedule is optimised for it, and my lack of mental clarity stole my potential grade.
- Chemistry: Very Worried for Upcoming Redox CAP Next Week. I don't think I've done enough preparation.
- Physics: Confused, but currently on top of Circular Motion. I fear that I have no motivation to self study as there are no upcoming tests.
- Japanese: Upcoming Reading Test I am extremely worried about. I have not revised too much for it, and I am losing a lot of marks in practices.
- English: Didn't study for comprehending but think I did good: Translation - I did not do good at all, but I fall once again victim to the Dunning-Kruger Effect.
