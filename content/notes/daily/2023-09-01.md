#daily
## updates
- transitioning to wikilinks, as it has autocomplete functionality and image resizing support for quartz
	- still need to test wikilinks for notes tho
	- [[notes/daily/daily|daily]] does this work? daily !! 
	- [[notes/archive/AE/SPECIALIST/inductionProof|inductionProof]] testing
- overhauling the folder format
	- from now on new notes will be created in the content folder, the folder navigation is just too painful for what its worth and id rather just use tags for navigation as it is much easier, also obisidan comes with a nice search bar
	- exceptions are daily, and images - everything else can be in the archive folder
	- you can see the first page at [[notes/helloWorld|helloWorld]]
