- today's main goal is finish reviewing all of Japaneses grammar, and start writing proper responses to hopefully put into an anki deck.
- secondary goal is to start review on chemistry and methods of future chapters, and completing them, as sai academy is skipped today.
	- i think i will complete sadler chapters for methods, and luarelli + stawa for chemistry
		- if i can find a creelman textbook ill do some practice questions, but if not that is alright.
		- i need to also put all my cards into the anki deck, and start mass reviewing them.
- speaking of anki, i need to finish all my cards today.
