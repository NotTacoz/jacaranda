if you get 99.9 atar -> you automatically get Melbourne Chancellor's Scholarship
if you are studying undergrad, then the government pays for a large amount of the fee, ~9k for 2024 bach in science. This is the same asÂ HECS Student Contribution, and if you get the **Melbourne Chancellor's Scholarship**, you are completely exempt of this fee, on top of your living expenses being paid for.
applying normally is kind of troll unless youre made with money, depending on what course you choose could cost 500k+
