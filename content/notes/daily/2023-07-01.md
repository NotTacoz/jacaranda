## Daily notes from now on! (for the next two weeks)
- School holidays are now upon us! I plan to make daily updates to my study process in these daily notes for the next two weeks, due to the excess amount of time I have.
- I really want to catch up on many subjects and study ahead in all of them, particularly Japanese but generally I want to be a high-achiever in all academic areas.

## Update on how I will approach Japanese study
- I have discovered anki decks which integrate anime text with flashcards, you can find it here:

	- https://www.mediafire.com/folder/h3c999hbd9r6m/subs2srs_decks
- I have downloaded the Darling in The Franxx and Sword Art Online flashcards, and my goal is to do 1,000 revisions by the end of the holidays. (~62.5 reviews a day)
- The two deck totals to 12,226 reviews :)))
- I am genuinely very excited to do these flashcards.
- There is a blog about it [here](https://www.japanese-like-a-breeze.com/a-million-flashcards/)
- I will update my progress everyday,
