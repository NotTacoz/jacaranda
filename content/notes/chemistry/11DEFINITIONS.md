- element: chemical substance unable to be broken down into other substances. All its atoms have the same number of protons.
compound: a substance made from two or more different elements chemically combined together.
atom: contains particles of protons, neutrons and electrons
isotope: atoms with the same amount of protons but different amount of neutrons

5 molecule: two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds COVALENTLY

Not all compounds are molecules - ms pilling e.g. NaCl google different

6 ion: atom with a positive or negative charge

Elemental ions: ions that are elements

Molecular ions: ions that are molecules

Complex ions: e.g. [CuCL4]^-2, [Cu(H2O)6]2+

7 Chemical symbol: letter or pair of letters used to represent an element

8 Relative atomic mass: the mass of the atom relative to the weight of protons and neutrons

9 Chemical formulae: shows the reactants taking part in a chemical reaction and the products formed from the reactants IN THE CORRECT PROPORTION

10 Chemical equation: symbolic representation of chemical reactions

11 Empirical formula: the simplest whole number ratio

12 Stoichiometry: the relationship between relative quantities of substances taking part in a chemical reaction
