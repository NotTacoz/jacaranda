# Energy Consumption & Fossil Fuels

## I can state what energy is.

- Energy is the capacity to do work.
- Can be transformed or transferred
    - This is where the energy is transformed from one type of energy into another.

[https://www.chemistrysteps.com/energy-and-organic-chemistry-reactions/](https://www.chemistrysteps.com/energy-and-organic-chemistry-reactions/)

## Energy Consumption

- The usage of energy in which energy is transformed and transferred to complete tasks
    - Everyday examples of energy usage include watching television, washing clothes, heating and lighting the home.

## Direct vs Indirect Energy Usage

- Direct: Energy that is directly converted from one form to another to complete a task.
    - Petrol in cars.
    - Burning coal in coal plants generates electricity to power households.
    - Gas-heated water.
    
- Indirect: Energy that requires multiple steps to complete a task.
    - Consuming food for human energy needs that are heated up or cooked from fossil fuel energy.
    - Burning fossil fuels (coal) generates electricity that powers television and other electronic devices, in which humans consumes as information via light and sound energy.
    - Transportation of humans to save them potential energy by creating mechanical energy.
    
    ## What is Fossil Fuel?
    
    - Petroleum, coal and natural gas are natural fuels formed by the remains of living organism which is burned as fuel.
    

### Formation Process of Crude Oil (Fossil Fuels)

When greenhouse gasses absorb infrared radiation, the molecules start to vibrate. The vibrational energy is a form of kinetic energy, which produces heat.

## The Greenhouse Effect Diagram

Climate Definition: Long-term weather patterns

### The Enhanced Greenhouse Effect

Methane Gas

‚Üí Traps Infrared Radiation

‚Üí Heats Earth‚Äôs atmospheres ‚Üí Increase in average global temperatures ‚Üí Change in weather patterns

‚Üí Altered ocean and wind currents

‚Üí Extra ice melting

‚Üí Extra sea level rising

‚Üí Rapid Climate Change

Such as:

- Higher bushfire rate and intensity.
- Higher temperature.

**TL:DR SUMMARY**: The Enhanced Greenhouse Effect is the process in which Methane Gas (most commonly sourced from cows, but could also be due to other factors) traps the infrared radiation produced from solar radiation, by blocking and absorbing the infrared radiation. This causes to heat the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, which increases the average global temperature. Climate Change describes Long-term weather pattern, and with increased average global temperatures, wind currents are altered, extra ice melts, and as a result of the ice melting, the sea level rises. This causes the long-term weather pattern to be disrupted and become chaotic, which results in undesirable natural disasters such as higher bushfire rate and intensity, as well as a higher temperature throughout the globe.

# Organic Chemistry

## What is Organic Chemistry?

- Organic Chemistry is the study of Hydrocarbon compounds.

## Fractional Distillation

- Crude oil is an exceptionally valuable resource.
    - Properties of a Black, Viscous, Thick and oozy liquid mixture.
    - It is a mixture of many different hydrocarbons compounds.
        - Hydrocarbon compounds contain different chain lengths.
            - Intermolecular forces are forces ***between*** molecules
                - The greater the number of molecules (hence having a longer chain), the greater the intermolecular force.
                - Hydrocarbons with shorter chains have weaker intermolecular force.
                - Less energy is to break/pull the shorter chained hydrocarbons. Vice versa.
                    - The process of breaking is evaporation of the chains, by turning it from liquid to gas.
                    - Heat energy is used to break apart the hydrocarbons.
                    - A higher temperature is required to break apart longer chained hydrocarbons.
            - Intramolecular forces are forces ***in*** molecules
- Fractional Distillation is a separation process based on differing boiling points of different fractions.
    - Fraction: A group of crude oil constituents that has a similar boiling point.
    - $\therefore$
- Through this, it provides Hydrocarbons, which is used to manufacture many different chemicals and even plastics.

## Fractional Distillation in Steps

1. In a furnace, the crude oil is heated up to a very high temperature.
2. The hot oil, now mostly in vapour form is pumped into the **fractionating column**.
    1. The fractionating column has a heat gradient.
        1. Hot at the bottom, Cool at the top.
3. Hydrocarbons rise through the **fractionating column** (as gas) making their way through bubble caps in each tray.
4. Depending on the boiling point, hydrocarbons will get to a same level in the **fractioning column, condense**, and be collected in a **fractionating tray** outside the column.
    1. The fractionating tray is a tray of hydrocarbons that has condensed at the same temperature
    2. Same boiling point hydrocarbons will have the same temperature where their chains are converted from liquid to gas.
5. Hydrocarbons with similar boiling point are collected in the same try and become one fraction.

TL:DR; Crude oil is a mixture of important hydrocarbons, and fractional distillation is the method used to separate the hydrocarbons in crude oil. Hydrocarbons move up the **fractionating column**, until each fraction turns into their respective liquid.

## Usage of different hydrocarbon fractions

    - Fuel for cars.

## Draw and identify structural isomers of hydrocarbons, including chain isomers and position isomers

## Isomers

- Isomers are organic molecules with the same molecular formula but different structures.
- As a result, the isomers differ in names, chemical properties and shape.

### Use IUPAC naming system to name structural isomers.

1. Find the parent chain
    1. Parent chain: longest continous chain of carbon atoms in the molecule.
2. Number the carbon atoms in the parent chain.
    - For Alkanes: the direction in which the branches is closest to the edge (smallest number).
    - For Alkenes: the direction in which the C=C is closest to the edge (smallest number).
3. Substituents
    1. Atoms attached to the parent chain.
    2. Name of the alyl groups.
    3. Substituents name also contains the position. E.g. 3-methyl and 5-ethyl substituents.
        1. This uses the numbering from the direction in step 2.
4. Use a prefix to indicate the appearance of more than one of the same substituent
    1. 2: Di, 3: Tri, 4; Tetra.
5. Substituents are listed in alphabetical order of the prefix
6. Commas are used to seperate multiple numbers. Hyphenes coome between the name and the number of a substitent. The parent name comes immediately after the last substituent. There are no blank spaces in the name.

## Chemical properties of Hydrocarbons.

### Definition of Viscosity, Volatility and Flammability.

### Viscosity

- Refers to the thickness of a fluid.
- Refers to how resistant a fluid is to move through it.
- The higher the viscosity, the thicker the fluid is.
- Honey has high viscosity whilst water has a low viscosity.

### Volatility

- How readily a substance vaporises or transitions from a liquid phase to a gas phase.
- High volatility = Low boiling point
- High volatility = Weaker intermolecular forces, thus fewer carbons in straight chain the higher the volatility.

### Flammability

Self explanatory KEKW

### Trends in physical properties of hydrocarbons (melting point, boiling point, viscosity, volatility, flammability)

Ranked in terms of highest relatively physical burning and melting points.

### Alyknes

Melting & Boiling Point

- Alkynes have a relatively higher physical burning and melting point than Alkanes.
    - $C_nH_{2n-2}$
    

### Alkanes

Melting & Boiling Point

- Alkanes have a relatively higher physical burning and melting point than Alkenes.
    - $C_nH_{2n}$

Viscosity

- Butane and alkanes with fewer carbons are gases at room temperature.
- Through to $C_{16}$, alkanes are liquids.
- Due to the increase of intermolecular forces between molecules increasing in size, the viscosity of liquid alkanes increases as the number of carbon increases.

Flammability

- Flammable and catch fire easily.

### Alkenes

- Alkenes have a relatively lower physical burning and melting point than Alkanes.
    - This is due to the different levels of intermolecular forces of attraction between the molecules of the hydrocarbon
    - $C_nH_{2n+2}$
