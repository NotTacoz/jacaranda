# Origins
-   Idea of matter is thought by Ancient Greek philosophers
-   They believed matter consisted of 4 elements, and matter was infinitely divisible.
-   New greek guy came alone and disagreed, and described a particle called atomos which is not divisible
-   Not challenged properly by the scientific community until late seventeenth century

# Breakthroughs and Discoveries
-   First evidence leading to discoveries began appearing very late in the 18th century.
-   “Law of conservation of mass”, published by Antoine Laurent Lavoisier.
-   He discovered there was no change in mass during a chemical reaction.

# John Dalton 1807
-   Atomic Theory of Matter, which states that
	1.  Elements are composed of small, indivisible particles called atoms.
	2.  Atoms of given element are identical having same size, mass and chemical properties.
	3.  Atoms of different elements have different size, mass and chemical properties.
	4.  Atoms are not created or destroyed during chemical reaction.
	5.  A chemical reaction involves only separation, combination. Or rearrangement of atoms.
	6.  Compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine in a specific ration.
	7.  Law of multiple proportions, two elements form more than one compound, ratio something something.
	8. Atom is a sphere
- Many of the atomic theory is wrong and disproven by modern atomic theory, but his original proposition granted a new perspective on atoms.
- Examples of disadvantages of his theory is:
	1. Atoms are divisible, they are made of smaller particles known as subatomic particles.
	2. Not all atoms for a given element are identical: some elements have atoms that differ in terms of <u>mass</u> and <u>density</u> (different number of neutrons). These are called isotopes.
	3. Elements are not in fact different in all aspects, eg argon calcium both have AMU of 40 (isobars)
	4. dalton claims elements combine in whole number ratio, which isnt true in complex compounds
	5. allotropes contradict the statement elements of the same kind have same properties. e.g. charcoal, graphite, diamond.
# JJ Thomson 1897
-   Discovered the electron.
- cathode ray experiment
	- in a partially evacuated glass tube, invisible rays called cathode rays are produced from a cathode, which causes certain materials (called phosphors) to glow.
	- Thomson observed and concluded that cathode rays was a stream of negatively charged particles with mass, which became known as electrons.
		- Passed through electric and magnetic fields:
			- cathode rays passed straight through
			- thus cathode rays are affected by electric and magnetic fields.
			- the field deviates towards the positive plate.
- He determined the mass of the particle to be 1/1000 AMU since the magnitude of the fields is known.
- ## plum pudding model
	- he knew atoms were neutral and contained negative charge.
		- therefore they must contain equal positive charge.
	- thomson suggested atom is comprised of electrons and protons spread with uniform mass and charge.
	- weaknesses
		- electrons is now known to be occupying fixed orbitals
		- under the model, alpha particles would repel against an element, which does not align with the results found in the gold leaf experiment.

# Ernest Rutherford 1908-1913
- alpha particles shoot at gold leaf (a thin sheet of gold a few atoms wide)
- surrounded by zinc sulfide
- alpha particles collide with zinc sulfide to make flashes of light and microscope is used to observe the impact position.
- observations:
	1. most alpha particles pass through gold foil
		- this means that most of an element is empty space
	2. some alpha particles were deflected (in a minor way)
		- the discovery of a neutral, the nucleus region in the atom.
		- there must exist a positively charged region called a proton.
		- this also means that the positively charged region is a small part of the atom.
	3. some alpha particles were deflected (significantly)
		- reconfirms that protons must be concentrated at the centre of the atom (nucleus)
- ### rutherfords model
	- atom comprises of mostly empty space. the space is occupied by electrons.
	- electron orbits a small central region (0.05%)
# Niels Bohr 1913
- Orbitals of electrons, and the line emission spectra.
- Scientists found that when an electric discharge is passed throguh a discharge tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, it emits light.
- The light when passed through a prism split sup into a set of 5 lines. This spectrum is called the line spectrum of hydrogen. This is known as the <u>line emission spectrum</u>. Scientists were unable to explain this.
- ## bohr's model
- bohr's model stated the following: (the three postulates)
	- **fixed orbital**: electrons move in a circular orbit around the nucleus under influence of electrostatic attraction of the nucleus.
	- **angular momentum is quantised**
		- electrons occupy fixed energy levels
		- these fixed energy levels do not emit radiation, as these orbits are stable ([Maxwell's Law](notes/chemistry/11MAXWELLS-LAW.md))
	- **energy transitions**: electrons can transition to higher or lower energy levels by emitting or absorbing fixed quantities of energy (photons)
		- an electron can transition to a higher state by absorbing a photo with energy equal to the exact difference in energies between 2 electron orbits (final and initial)
		- an electron can transition to a lower state by emitting a photo with energy equal to the exact difference in energies between 2 electron orbits (final and initial)
- ### emission spectra
	- when an electric discharge is passed throguha.


# Development of atomic structure

Atomic theory, ancient greeks thought everything was made of a solid matter which cannot be broken down even more

John dalton proposed atoms as solid spheres, and there exists different types of spheres for different elements.

JJ Thompson plum pudding model - showed that there exists electrons (negatively charged particles) inside the atom

Ernest Rutherford nuclear model, discovered the nucleus, and assumed negative charge surrounds it through the gold leaf experiment, some alpha particles were deflected. Flaw was electron rush into nucleus causing it to collapse

Niels bohr proposed electron orbit and energy levels of electrons.

Ground state blah blah blah
