## 1.2 specific heat capacity
- you can see my previous notes at [[notes/archive/AE/PHYSICS/heat|heat]] pls ty
- small amount of water in a kettle will experience greater change in temperature than a large volume if heated for some time.
- metal object gets hotter faster than a wooden object.
- large heaters warm rooms faster than small ones.
- the significance of these observation is that mass, material, and the amount of energy transferred influence any change of temperature.
### changing temperature
- temperature of a substance is measure of the average kinetic energy of particles inside the substance.
- greater the mass of substance, greater the energy required to change kinetic energy - so heat required to raise temperature by a given amount is proportional to mass of substance.
