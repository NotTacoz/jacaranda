title: "matrices"

## background
- used to represent linear transformations (like in computer animations)
- it is a rectangular (though often square) array of mathematical objects.
- if it has **m** rows and **n** columns, it is called an **m** x **n** matrix
- entries in the matrix can be indexed using subscripts for the row and column
	- $a_{13}$ is in  row 1, column 3 = 0
$$A=\begin{bmatrix}
3 & -1 & 0 \\ 4 & -2 & 3
\end{bmatrix}$$
## matrix equality
- if and only if they have same number of rows and columns, and all corresponding entries are equal.
## addition and multiplication of matrices
- notes not needed (intuitive and straightforward)
