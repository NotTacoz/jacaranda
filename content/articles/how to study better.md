## These are notes to random videos I watch on study techniques, almost none of these thoughts or ideas are mine.
## 1. Deep Work
- Deep Work is always better than Shallow Work.
- Treat the ability to focus like a muscle.
	- The ability to focus can be trained, just like the ability to get distracted.
	- Don't build the identity.
- Get rid of distractions
- Work in the morning before you eat, it will give you an incredible focus.
- Chase goals more meaningful for you.

## 2. Artificial Deadlines
- Uses Parkinsons Law
	- Something along the lines of the time you spend on something changes depending on the amount of time you assign it.
	- This is the reason why you cram and spend the last week doing something of an assignment with a month due date.
- The solution is to incorporate an artificial deadline to be prepared way before the actual event.

## 3. Retrospective Timetable
- Students often
	- Setting a specific amount of time on each study session.
		- The problem with that your focus is in the wrong place, you will be trying to waste time and let it pass easily, and as a result, you're learning sub optimally.
	- Studying topics in a chronological order.
		- You're not studying in the most efficient order.
		- You need to focus on weaknesses, as they are the things you need to allocate the most resources on.
			- Think of it like a COC base, if you use all your gold upgrading your base from the top to the bottom, your base will never be well defended from all sides.
- Use Retrospective Table to go through weaknesses.
