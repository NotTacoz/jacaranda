## These are notes to random videos I watch on study techniques, almost none of these thoughts or ideas are mine.
## 1. Deep Work
- Deep Work is always better than Shallow Work.
- Treat the ability to focus like a muscle.
	- The ability to focus can be trained, just like the ability to get distracted.
	- Don't build the identity.
- Get rid of distractions
- Work in the morning before you eat, it will give you an incredible focus.
- Chase goals more meaningful for you.

## 2. Artificial Deadlines
- Parkinsons Law
