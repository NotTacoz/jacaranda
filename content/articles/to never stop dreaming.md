*this is not about the minecraft youtuber.*

it is once said that the two most important days in your entire life is the day you are born, and the day you find out why. why god, or evolution, or whatever higher power or not, arranged a world so precise to allow you, the reader, to not just exist, but live.

between the days we live and exist, humans all share the common experience of dreaming. perhaps in a literal sense, you dream, in bed. of the assessment haunting you for the last two weeks, or in a metaphorical sense, of the life as a billionaire, driving in sports cars and drinking expensive wine (though preferably not both). 

the power to dream is the greatest power one could have, but it could also be one's greatest downfall. we dream so we can envision our goals, and what we want. we dream, to remind us of deadlines, and whats to come. though if you let yourself to be blinded by our dreams, we focus too much on the goal, and too little on the process.

i'd like to think of dreams as a perpetual "idea machine" which gives you reasons why. are you solely here to complete that lingering english composing, or are you here to achieve your goals and make your dreams a reality.
