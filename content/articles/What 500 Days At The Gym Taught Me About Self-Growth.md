I have to be honest. I don't actually know if it has been 500 days since I have been consistently going to the gym. I might have gone for a longer period of time, but taking away rest days, I might've gone less than 500 times total. 500 is just a nice number.

To preface, I don't go the gym for long, I spend my lunch times everyday for the past year and a bit more in the gym, so about 20 minutes of time to workout. To me, the gym is also a place to socialise and talk with friends, so in reality, I'd estimate I spend just above 10 minutes actually doing proper exercise.

Despite that, the gym has yielded some although not impressive, satisfactory results, which I am personally decently happy with.

This brings to the first point of what the gym taught me: 
## 1. Minimum Effort Over a Maximum Time.
For any skill, more than anything, the amount of time you put it in develops it the most. Time spent on a certain *skill* is able to beat 99.9% of genetics. And if you want to increase the time spent on a skill, consistency is what develops it the most.

I initially went to the gym to better myself and become "healthy" by partaking in the bare-minimum amount of exercise to keep me a happy boy. Before I knew it, it soon became a daily regiment I followed every lunch time.

I never thought I pushed myself to an "extreme extent". I went to the gym, did some light exercise to make a certain muscle group sore, and got out. This was time I would have otherwise just sat around doing nothing and waiting for the next period to come, so overall, I derived my results from almost nothing.
