## Introduction
This is a definitive guide (for 2023) for Japanese Learning, and is my ideal routine and workings to improve my Japanese.

Disclaimer: I am not good at Japanese, but this is the workflow I have optimised (and will continue optimising) for the rest of my language learning journey.

This article merely serves as a milestone to what I was doing as of December 2023.

To understand what I want to derive from this, we need to understand INPUT and OUTPUT.

## Input & Output
Most Japanese learners suggest that outputting comes AFTER inputting, and that a majority of beginners should completely DISREGARD output, as to optimise output (aka speak with little to no mistakes), one must have the ability to RECOGNISE what they are saying, and fix it, without external help. 

However, the ATAR course is DIFFERENT from this journey, which assumes you have an almost infinite amount of time, estimating years, of advancing your Japanese journey, and no rush to be able to comprehensively output spoken Japanese. Also, most of these learners and their goals revolve understanding, and not really conversing (Because they are massive weebs and only want to watch anime without subtitles).
