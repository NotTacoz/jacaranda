## 340 Days Left of Year 12

340 days left until I take my last class in Perth Modern School.

340 days left until I see my friends as Year 12s for the last time.

340 days until I say my first but not final goodbyes.

340 Days Left of Year 12

After this, who knows what will happen?

We will get our separate jobs.

Our separate friends.

Our separate houses.

Some of us will move far away.

Others will stay closer than we would have ever expected.

Things will have slowly changed, a sense of impermanence would probably rush over when reflecting on the past. A considerable different, but many the same. A legacy will be built from the Class of 2024 - a tower of *laughter*, *tears*, *frustration* and *celebration*. Would we be sad - that the future is over? Or would we be happy - that the future is beginning? Perhaps it is a mixture of both.

But it's too early to think about the future. The unpredictability of the future is what makes it fun, how life is always one step ahead, no matter the trivial planning we could do, there could always be one bad gamble that lead us down a tumbling hill.

The present is what is important. The friends and enemies we make along the way. The memories of the drama, friendships and  **connection** brought together by our common interest of conquering the tower known as ATAR.

This was the longest, toughest marathon we have participated in our life. But it won't be the last. This is where the finish line appears in view of some students, the [[articles/Ariadnes' Thread|Ariadnes' Thread]] leading us out of the labyrinth.

Soon, the calmest before the stormiest would be upon us - the summer holidays. And after - Who knows what will happen.
