CONCEPT: Everybody has a limited amount of time they can dedicate on a specific task. This is extremely limited in which if we spend 8 hours sleeping, 6 hours bodily functions, we can only maximise 10 hours a day on what really matters to us.

1) Diet
No Carbs (until after work), No Sugar AT ALL, Don't drink caffeine - it is COPE
They take too much energy to digest

>[!note] FOCUS REQUIRES ENERGY. The best way to improve focus is to do less things requiring energy. Digesting Carbs requires a lot of energy.

2) Morning
Stimulated -> Energetic brain state has a lot of resistance.
Do things before work that helps you to focus. Do not stimulate your brain with a bunch of shit, because this creates a higher amount of resistance. Doing Rewarding things in the morning to doing things that requires patience is very autistic and requires a lot of energy.

Do things that requires delayed gratification in the morning - running, calisthenics, meditating and other calm things. NO MUSIC. Don't go on stimuli like instagram during work breaks. Do the desire for stimuli and chaos AFTER work.

3) Awareness
Be aware of your thought. What are you thinking of? There are two distractions: Internal, External.
- Internal: Your thoughts
- External: Your environment - Notifications, Knock on the Door
Analyse your thoughts!

Every time you get distracted, write it somewhere, and over time, you become aware of your distractions and actively work against it.

Meditation:
Pomodoro is BS! You can focus for much longer than 25 minutes.

Meditating to improve focus. It trains the part of your mind dedicated to focus.

Very Simple: Initially you might be bad at it because your brain is so fucked. Noise cancelling headphones if you need.
1. Upright, straight posture
2. Shut your eyes
3. Focus on your breath - The sensation between your nostrils
Acknowledge and ignore your thoughts.
- This build the ability to subconsciously correct the loop of being distracted.
- This MASSIVELY improves your rate of focus.

4) All or Nothing
How your brain does one thing is how it does everything.

If you are doing something, it will become routine for everything.

E.g. Obsess with finishing things. You can NEVER skip a spotify song, you can NEVER stop watching a movie, if you're doing a thing OBSESS with finishing it. "Borderline austistic" Seek focus EVERYWHERE. Singletasking is king.

5) Environment
Create a physical and digital environment that makes focus really easy.
Fix digital environment too.
Environment always wins over willpower.
