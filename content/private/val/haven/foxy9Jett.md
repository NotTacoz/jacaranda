A-A meaning: Foxy9 Plays A - Enemies go A

## Defence

### Round 1: Pistol A-A (Sheriff)

- Starts A long, crosses to the left side (behind the boxes), for an off angle for long.
- Shoots two bullets and tucking back before popping his dash.
  - dash timing and when he is darted is the around the same time, suggesting he mightve popped dash when sova darted him.
- reloaded behind boxes, still hasnt dashed yet.
  - spammed and then dashed, going for a lucky kill.
- goes back towards short, for an off angle to sewers![300](notes/images/Screen%20Shot%202023-08-14%20at%207.43.43%20pm.png)
- jiggling from the right side box.
- loses

### Round 2: Eco B-A (Sheriff 1 smoke No shields)

- starts from left side, watching window, getting ready to push down mid.
- nobody swings window, and he walks down mid.
- goes for a flank, full walking. (gun out most of the time, careful of any flank watchers, as enemy doesn't have a flank watch)
- used smoke to scale up and get vandal.
- loses eco, but gets 3 nice

### Round 3: Full Buy A-C split(?) (Vandal Light Smoke)

- does same thing as pistol round, crosses towards the left side behind the box at long. ![400](notes/images/Screen%20Shot%202023-08-14%20at%207.48.47%20pm.png)
- goes for an off angle crouch, still holding A.
- very late to rotate, so i think he will flank. lets see (he didnt, rotated through spawn)
- still jiggling A lobby.
- rotates through CT, one is spawn.
- util and coordination with teammate. "LETS PEEK TOGETHER"

### Round 4: Full Buy A-A (Vandal, Two smokes, light)

- does same thing pistol and round 3
  - cross, pop dash when in danger.
- he popped dash right before he kill jett, preparing from the swing and trade i think.
- gets kill on jett
- jiggles and goes for preaim kill.
- walks up short to isolate long guy
  - gets blind.
- walks away, rotating.
- late for retake, so he flanks.

  - mid -> garage

- continue later XD
