Use the Arrhenius model to define and describe acids and bases in aqueous solution.\n### Capabilities of Arrhenius Model\nArrhenius (Swedish Chemist) described a theory of acid-base behaviour centred on the ability of certain substances that contain H or OH to produce hydrogen ions, $H^{+}$ (aq) or hydroxide ions, $OH^-$ (aq) when dissolved in water. His theory states that:\n- an **acid** is a substance that will **ionise** in solution producing $H^+$ (aq) ions\n\t- eg $$HNO_{3}(aq)\\to H^+(aq)+NO_{3}^-(aq)\\dots\\dots$$\n- a **base** is a substance that will **dissociate** in solution producing $OH^-$ (aq) ions\n\t- eg $$NaOH(s)\\to OH^-(aq)+Na^+(aq)\\dots\\dots$$\n- the theory gives a good account of the acid-base behaviour of many acids and ionic hydroxides.\n### Weaknesses of Arrhenius Model\n- to able to explain or predict the acid-base behaviour of many other compounds:\n\t- for example, why salts like sodium carbonate and potassium phosphate (which do not contain OH) are basic in nature and not neutral.\n\t- the Brønsted–Lowry model is more comprehensive and gives a broader and more satisfactory account of acid-base behaviour\n\n## Comparing 0.1 mol/L HCl and 1.0 mol/L CH3COOH\n- CH3COOH has a larger concentration\n- HCl is a stronger acid because it **disassociates fully**\n- HCl has more electrolytes so it is more conductive than CH3COOH\n\n## Reactions of Acids\n- metal (s) + acid (aq) -\u003e salt (check w/ solubility table) + hydrogen gas (g)\n- metal oxide (s) + acid (aq) -\u003e salt (check w/ solubility table) + water (l)\n- metal hydroxide (check) + acid (aq) -\u003e salt (check) + water (l)\n- metal carbonate (check) + acid (aq) -\u003e salt (check) + water (l) + carbon dioxie (g)\n- metal hydrogen carbonate (check/trust observation/read q) + acid (aq) -\u003e salt (check) + water (l) + carbon dioxide (g)\n\t- Ca(HCO3)2 (aq) +2HCl (aq) -\u003e CaCl2 (aq) + 2H2O (l) + 2CO2 (g)\n\n## Ionic Reactions\n- in most areas of chemistry, we write **ionic reactions**, not molecular reactions (even if it is not asked, we assume it wants balanced ionic reactions with state symbols)\n- for acids and bases, write and determine what type of acid and bases you are dealing with.\n\t- eg $NaOH (aq)+HCl(aq)\\to NaCl(aq)+H_{2}O(l)$\n\t- **strong** base + **strong** acid (this step is **important**, explained why later)\n\t- $Na^+(aq)+OH^-(aq)+H^+(aq)+Cl^-(aq)\\to Na^+(aq)+Cl^-(aq)+H_{2}O (l)$\n\t- remove spectator ions:\n\t- $OH^-(aq)+H^+(aq)\\to H_{2}O(l)$\n\t- if it is a weak acid, then in solution it is present as the same thing.\n\t\t- eg CH3COOH -\u003e CH3COOH because it is a weak acid (from molecular to ionic)","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T05:46:50.672891094Z","tags":null},"/notes/AE/CHEMISTRY/chemistry":{"title":"chemistry","content":"## Content\n## Semester 2\n#### Term 3\n- [Acids and Bases](notes/AE/CHEMISTRY/acidsAndBases.md)","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T05:46:50.672891094Z","tags":null},"/notes/AE/ENGLISH/english":{"title":"english","content":"## Case Studies\n- [Tim Burton](notes/AE/ENGLISH/timBurton.md)","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T05:46:50.672891094Z","tags":null},"/notes/AE/ENGLISH/timBurton":{"title":"The Nightmare Before Tim Burton","content":"\n## Who is He?\nTim Burton is an American Filmmaker and animator.

As a science fiction film, Planet of The Apes should be grounded in some sort of science and realism. Tim Burton's style differs from this, where he excels in the mysterious and the unknown, where he creates unsettling and gothic costume and set designs to excel the film's characteristics.\n- Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)\n- Alice in Wonderland (2010)\n- Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (2016)\n- Wednesday (2022)\n\n## What style is he most known for?\nTim Burton is known for his playful gothic style of direction.

Moves at speed of light.\n- No mass.\n- Often emitted after alpha or beta radiation.\n- Weakly ionising.\n- High penetration requiring concrete/lead.\n### Neutrons\n- If too many neutrons occurs,

multiplying two matrices\n- matrices can be multiplied even if they do not have same dimensions.\n- work through the rows of the first matrix, and the column of the second.\n\t- form the scalar product for each row and column of the first and second matrix.\n- properties of matrix multiplication creates certain rules within matrices.\n\t- two matrices can be multiplied together provided the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix.\n\t- suppose matrix A has dimension m x n, and matrix B has dimensions p x q.\n\t\t- the product $A_{mn}B_{pq}$ can only be formed if $n=p$.\n\t\t\t- in this case AB will have dimension m x q.\n\t\t- the product $B_{pq}A_{mn}$ can only be formed if $q=m$.\n\t\t\t- in this case BA will have dimension p x n.z\n\t\t- in the product AB we say that B is **premultiplied** by A **or** A is **postmultiplied** by B.\n\n## zero matrix\n- 0 is called the additive identity of the real numbers\n- consider the matrix: $$\\begin{pmatrix}\n1\u00266\\\\-2\u00265\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n- then: $$\\begin{pmatrix}\n1\u00266\\\\-2\u00265\n\\end{pmatrix}+\\begin{pmatrix}\n0\u00260\\\\0\u00260\n\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n1\u00266\\\\-2\u00265\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n- for a given matrix size mxn, the matrix $0_{m\\times n}$\n- the 0 matrix leaves the other matrix unchanged.\n## identity matrix\n- in normal multiplication, $x \\times 1$ is always x\n- in matrices, the matrix X multiplied by the identity matrix is always X\n- consider the matrix: $$\\begin{pmatrix}\n1\u00266\\\\-2\u00265\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n- then the identity matrix (1 0 \\ 0 1) and multiplied $$\\begin{pmatrix}\n1\u00266\\\\-2\u00265\n\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}\n1\u00260\\\\0\u00261\n\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n1\u00266\\\\-2\u00265\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n### consider non-square matrices\n- consider the matrix: $$\\begin{pmatrix}\n6\u00261\u0026-4\\\\8\u00260\u00262\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n- to multiply by a matrix and attain the same matrix: $$? \\times \\begin{pmatrix}\n6\u00261\u0026-4\\\\8\u00260\u00262\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n6\u00261\u0026-4\\\\8\u00260\u00262\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n? would be: $$\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \u0026 0 \\\\0\u00261\n\\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix}\n6\u00261\u0026-4\\\\8\u00260\u00262\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n6\u00261\u0026-4\\\\8\u00260\u00262\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n- then what about the case where: $$\\begin{pmatrix}\n6\u00261\u0026-4\\\\8\u00260\u00262\n\\end{pmatrix} \\times ?= \\begin{pmatrix}\n6\u00261\u0026-4\\\\8\u00260\u00262\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n- then: $$\\begin{pmatrix}\n6\u00261\u0026-4\\\\8\u00260\u00262\n\\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \u0026 0 \u00260\\\\0\u00261\u00260\\\\0\u00260\u00261\n\\end{pmatrix}= \\begin{pmatrix}\n6\u00261\u0026-4\\\\8\u00260\u00262\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n- the notation of the identity matrix is $I_{x}$ with x being the dimensions (only 1 dimension is needed because the identity matrix is always square)\n\n#### a word of warning\n- the matrices A x B = C in which C is a 0 matrix, and A is not a matrix, B is **NOT ALWAYS** a 0 matrix.\n- furthermore, in normal arithmetic, 3a = 3b, such a = b\n\t- therefore in matrices, AB = CB, therefore A = C\n\t\t- THIS IS INCORRECT\n\t\t- consider $$AB=\\begin{bmatrix}\n3\u00261\\\\1\u00264\n\\end{bmatrix},B=\\begin{bmatrix}\n1\\\\2\n\\end{bmatrix}, C=\\begin{bmatrix}\n-3\u00262\\\\5\u00262\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\t\t\t- in this case AB = CB, B!=0, but A != C\n- same case for identity matrices as well. you **CANNOT** assume an unknown matrix is the identity matrix.\n\n## matrix division\n- there is no concept of matrix division but theres something similar (?)\n- consider multiplying 4 by 3\n\t- $3 \\times 4 = 12$\n- to get back to 4 from 12, you could divide 12 by 3\n\t- $12 \\div 3 = 4$\n- alternatively you could multiply 12 by $\\frac{1}{3}$\n\t- $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 12 = 4$\n- this is because $\\frac{1}{3} \\times 3 = 1$\n- there is no division operation in matrix arithmetic, but we can use the second method to 'undo' multiplication by a matrix: $$AB=C$$\n- to get B from C, multiply (on the left) by a matrix $A^{-1}$ such that $A^{-1}A=I$\n$$A^{-1}AB=A^{-1}C$$$$IB=A^{-1}C$$\n$$B=A^{-1}C$$\nthe matrix $A^{-1}$ is called the inverse matrix.\n#### how to find the inverse matrix\n- given a matrix A, how do you find the inverse matrix $A^{-1}$\n- messy process:\n\t- $2 \\times 2$ case:\n\t- let: $$A=\\begin{pmatrix}\na\u0026b\\\\c\u0026d\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\t- we need to find the matrix $$A^{-1}=\\begin{pmatrix}\nw\u0026x\\\\y\u0026z\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n\t- preferably with $w,x,y$ and $z$ given in terms of $a,b,c$ and $d$.\n\t- we know that $A\\times A^{-1}=I$\n\t- blah blah blah rearrange expression you get (for the 2x2 case)\n\t- $w=\\frac{d}{ad-bc}$ and blah blah for x, y, z\n- therefore: for $$A=\\begin{pmatrix}\na\u0026b\\\\c\u0026d\n\\end{pmatrix},A^{-1}=\\frac{1}{ad-bc}\\begin{pmatrix}\nd\u0026-b\\\\-c\u0026a\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n#### (ad-bc) is the **determinant** of A, written det A or $\\mid A\\mid$\n- it is possible that $\\frac{1}{ad-bc}=0$\n- a matrix with an inverse is **invertible**.\n- a matrix with no inverse is **singular** (or just **non-invertible** lol)\n\n## Recap\n- multiplicative identity matrix\n\t- always a square, and when it is multiplied to a given matrix, the matrix remains unchanged.\n- the inverse of a given matrix has the property of multiplying the given matrix to gain the identity matrix.\n- to find the inverse of a 2x2 matrix\n- for $$A=\\begin{pmatrix}\na\u0026b\\\\c\u0026d\n\\end{pmatrix},A^{-1}=\\frac{1}{ad-bc}\\begin{pmatrix}\nd\u0026-b\\\\-c\u0026a\n\\end{pmatrix}$$ \n- there may be a case where an inverse does not exist, which is where $\\frac{1}{ad-bc}=0$\n\n## solving a system of a linear

This is where the energy is transformed from one type of energy into another.\n\n[https://www.chemistrysteps.com/energy-and-organic-chemistry-reactions/](https://www.chemistrysteps.com/energy-and-organic-chemistry-reactions/)\n\n## Energy Consumption\n\n- The usage of energy in which energy is transformed and transferred to complete tasks\n    - Everyday examples of energy usage include watching television, washing clothes, heating and lighting the home.\n\n## Direct vs Indirect Energy Usage\n\n- Direct: Energy that is directly converted from one form to another to complete a task.\n    - Petrol in cars.\n    - Burning coal in coal plants generates electricity to power households.\n    - Gas-heated water.\n    \n- Indirect: Energy that requires multiple steps to complete a task.\n    - Consuming food for human energy needs that are heated up or cooked from fossil fuel energy.\n    - Burning fossil fuels (coal) generates electricity that powers television and other electronic devices, in which humans consumes as information via light and sound energy.\n    - Transportation of humans to save them potential energy by creating mechanical energy.\n    \n    ## What is Fossil Fuel?\n    \n    - Petroleum, coal and natural gas are natural fuels formed by the remains of living organism which is burned as fuel.\n    \n\n### Formation Process of Crude Oil (Fossil Fuels)\n\n→ Microscopic ORGANIC plankton/phytoplankton in ocean photosynthesises \n\n→ The organisms die and fall to the bottom of the ocean where they are covered by sediment \n\n→ Layers of heavy sediment cause compaction (pressure) and are subjected to high temperature \n\n→ Millions of years \n\n→ Crude oil and Natural Gas forms\n\n→ Encased in a sedimentary rock\n\n### Formation Process of Coal (Fossil Fuels)\n\n→ Ancient swamp forests photosynthesise\n\n→ The organisms die and fall to the bottom of the forest floor where they are covered by sediment \n\n→ Layers of heavy sediment cause compaction (pressure) and are subjected to

This causes to heat the Earth’s atmosphere, which increases the average global temperature. Climate Change describes Long-term weather pattern, and with increased average global temperatures, wind currents are altered, extra ice melts, and as a result of the ice melting, the sea level rises. This causes the long-term weather pattern to be disrupted and become chaotic, which results in undesirable natural disasters such as higher bushfire rate and intensity, as well as a higher temperature throughout the globe.\n\n# Organic Chemistry\n\n## What is Organic Chemistry?\n\n- Organic Chemistry is the study of Hydrocarbon compounds.\n\n## Fractional Distillation\n\n- Crude oil is an exceptionally valuable resource.\n    - Properties of a Black, Viscous, Thick and oozy liquid mixture.\n    - It is a mixture of many different hydrocarbons compounds.\n        - Hydrocarbon compounds contain different chain lengths.\n            - Intermolecular forces are forces ***between*** molecules\n                - The greater the number of molecules (hence having a longer chain), the greater the intermolecular force.\n                - Hydrocarbons with shorter chains have weaker intermolecular force.\n                - Less energy is to break/pull the shorter chained hydrocarbons. Vice versa.\n                    - The process of breaking is evaporation of the chains, by turning it from liquid to gas.\n                    - Heat energy is used to break apart the hydrocarbons.\n                    - A higher temperature is required to break apart longer chained hydrocarbons.\n            - Intramolecular forces are forces ***in*** molecules\n- Fractional Distillation is a separation process based on differing boiling points of different fractions.\n    - Fraction: A group of crude oil constituents that has a similar boiling point.\n    - $\\therefore$\n- Through this, it provides Hydrocarbons, which is used to manufacture many different chemicals and even plastics.\n\n## Fractional Distillation in Steps\n\n1. In a furnace, the crude oil is heated up to a very high temperature.\n2. The hot oil, now mostly in vapour form is pumped into the **fractionating column**.\n    1. The fractionating column has a heat gradient.\n        1. Hot at the bottom, Cool at the top.\n3. Hydrocarbons rise through the **fractionating column** (as gas) making their way through bubble caps in each tray.\n4. Depending on the boiling point, hydrocarbons will get to a same level in the **fractioning column, condense**, and be collected in a **fractionating tray** outside the column.\n    1. The fractionating tray is a tray of hydrocarbons that has condensed at the same temperature\n    2. Same boiling point hydrocarbons will have the same temperature where their chains are converted from liquid to gas.\n5. Hydrocarbons with similar boiling point are collected in the same try and become one fraction.\n\nTL:DR; Crude oil is a mixture of important hydrocarbons, and fractional distillation is the method used to separate the hydrocarbons in crude oil. Hydrocarbons move up the **fractionating column**, until each fraction turns into their respective liquid.\n\n## Usage of different hydrocarbon fractions\n\n- Petrol\n    - Fuel for cars.\n- Naptha\n    - Essential ingredient for plastic, and other plastics.\n- Kerosine\n    - Aircraft fuel.\n- Diesel\n    - Cars or vans.\n- Bitumen\n    - A mixture of large chained hydrocarbons used to lay road.\n- Butane\n    - The gas that comes out of gas taps in the school classrooms.\n\n## Alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, cycloalkanes, cycloalkenes\n\n+functional groups and generale formula :)\n\n\u003caside\u003e\n🗒️ Naming doesn’t yet account for isomers (covered in another section)\n\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\n### Alkyl\n\nMethyl $CH_3$\n\nEthyl $C_2H_3$\n\nPropyl $C_3H_7$\n\n- Question: Compare saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons\n- Answer: Each carbon atom bonds with the maximum number of hydrogen atoms in a saturated Hydrocarbon.\n    - Compared to, an unsaturated hydrocarbon, where less than the maximum amount of hydrogen is bonded to carbons.\n        \n        Saturated hydrocarbons are relatively unreactive.

Elements are composed of extremely small, indivisible particles called atoms.\n\t2. All Atoms of given element are identical having same size, mass and chemical properties. Atoms of different elements have different size, mass and chemical properties.\n\t3. Atoms are not created or destroyed during chemical reaction.\n\t4. A chemical reaction involves only separation, combination. Or rearrangement of atoms.\n\t5. Compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine in a specific ratio.\n- Many of the atomic theory is wrong and disproven by modern atomic theory (1, 2, 5), but his original proposition granted a new perspective on atoms.\n- ### three laws (DO WE EVEN NEED TO KNOW THIS)\n\t- #### The law of definite proportions:\n\t\t- mr dalton proposed \"compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine in a specific ratio\" \n\t\t- this is true given our modern understanding of chemistry.\n\t\t- e.g. calcium oxide will only occur with ca and o in fixed ratios\n\t- #### The law of conservation of mass\n\t\t- mr dalton proposed \"atoms are not created nor destroyed or changed into different types; a chemical reaction involves separation, combination or rearrangement of atoms.\" thus there must be the same amount of atoms in the reactants of a chemical reaction as the atoms in the product.\n\t- #### The law of multiple proportions\n\t\t- mr dalton proposed \"whenever two elements form more than one compound, the different masses of one element that combines with a fixed mass of the \" WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG THIS IS LIMITED AND DISPROVEN THROUGH POLYMERS (?) AND OLIGOMERS (?)\n- ## disadvantages of his theory:\n\t1. Atoms are divisible, they are made of smaller particles known as subatomic particles.\n\t2. Not all atoms for a given element are identical: some elements have atoms that differ in terms of \u003cu\u003emass\u003c/u\u003e and \u003cu\u003edensity\u003c/u\u003e (different number of neutrons). These are called isotopes.\n\t3. Elements are not in fact different in all aspects, eg argon calcium both have AMU of 40 (isobars)\n\t4. dalton claims elements combine in whole number ratio, which isn't true in complex compounds\n\t5. allotropes contradict the statement elements of the same kind have same properties. e.g. charcoal, graphite, diamond.\n\t6. no suggestion to the structure of the atom\n# JJ Thomson 1897-1904\n- Discovered the electron.\n- cathode ray experiment\n\t- in a sealed (evaporated) glass tube, metal terminals are placed at each end, acting as electrodes.\n\t- invisible rays called cathode rays are produced from a cathode (negative terminal) towards the anode, which causes certain materials (called phosphors, such as neon) to glow.\n\t- Thomson observed and concluded that cathode rays was a stream of negatively charged particles with mass, which became known as electrons.\n\t\t- Passed through electric and magnetic fields:\n\t\t\t- cathode rays passed straight through\n\t\t\t\t- thus cathode rays are affected by electric and magnetic fields.\n\t\t\t- the field deviates towards the positive plate. \n\t\t\t\t- thus the ray is negatively charged\n\t\t\t- diagram: ![](content/notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020230301090847.png)\n- He determined the mass of the particle to be ~1/2000 AMU since the magnitude of the fields is known.\n- he realised that\n\t- atoms contain negatively charged particles.\n\t\t- he repeated the experiment with multiple types of materials in the cathode, but the beam is produced every time.\n\t- since all atoms are neutral:\n\t- atoms also must contain a positively charged particles.\n- ## plum pudding model\n\t- he knew atoms were neutral and contained negative charge.\n\t\t- therefore they must contain equal positive charge.\n\t- thomson suggested atom is comprised of electrons and protons spread with uniform mass and charge.\n\t- weaknesses\n\t\t- electrons is now known to be occupying fixed orbitals\n\t\t- under the model, alpha particles would not be deflected against an element, and passes right through, which does not align with the results found in the gold leaf experiment.\n\n# Ernest Rutherford 1911\n- alpha particles shoot at gold leaf (a thin sheet of gold a few atoms wide)\n- sheet is surrounded by zinc sulfide\n\t- alpha particles collide with zinc sulfide to make flashes of light and microscope is used to observe the impact position.\n- observations:\n\t1. most alpha particles pass through gold foil\n\t\t- this means that most of an element is empty space\n\t2. some alpha particles were deflected (in a minor way)\n\t\t- the discovery of a neutral, the nucleus region in the atom.\n\t\t- there must exist a positively charged region called a proton.\n\t\t- this also means that the positively charged region is a small part of the atom.\n\t3. some alpha particles were deflected (significantly)\n\t\t- reconfirms that protons must be concentrated at the centre of the atom (nucleus)\n\t- expectations of the atom was that\n\t\t- the alpha particles pass through the atom or none passes through, but instead some were deflected.\n- ### rutherfords model\n\t- atom comprises of mostly empty space. the space is occupied by electrons.\n\t- electron orbits a small central region (0.05%)\n# Niels Bohr 1913\n- Orbitals of electrons, and the line emission spectra.\n- Scientists found that when an electric discharge is passed throguh a discharge tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, it emits light.\n- The light when passed through a prism split sup into a set of 5 lines. This spectrum is called the line spectrum of hydrogen. This is known as the \u003cu\u003eline emission spectrum\u003c/u\u003e. Scientists were unable to explain this.\n- ## bohr's model\n- bohr's model stated the following: (the three postulates)\n\t- **fixed orbital**: electrons move in a circular orbit around the nucleus under influence of electrostatic attraction of the nucleus.\n\t- **angular momentum is quantised**\n\t\t- electrons occupy fixed energy levels\n\t\t- these fixed energy levels do not emit radiation, as these orbits are stable (see [Maxwell's Law](notes/archive/AEold/chemistry/lessonnotes/MAXWELLS-LAW.md))\n\t- **energy transitions**: electrons can transition to higher or lower energy levels by emitting or absorbing fixed quantities of energy (photons)\n\t\t- an electron can transition to a higher state by absorbing a photo with energy equal to the exact difference in energies between 2 electron orbits (final and initial)\n\t\t- an electron can transition to a lower state by emitting a photo with energy equal to the exact difference in energies between 2 electron orbits (final and initial)\n- ### emission spectra\n\t- when an electric discharge is passed through a discharge tube, electrons that are found in the discharge transfer some kinetic energy during collision to the atoms' electrons.\n\t- the electron issued the atom is then excited to a higher energy state, and the incident electron will decelerate and be deflected in another direction (?)\n\t- electrons become unstable in higher energy state, and will transition down to the ground state. \n\t\t- this releases energy in the form of radiation, the energy is equal to E2-E1.\n\t- frequency of the radiation (therefore colour) is proportional to the energy it has, one specific wavelength/frequency of light will be produced per transition.\n\t- a unique set of photons with a specific wavelength is produced (as multiple transitions can occur within an atom). when these emissions are captured and analysed in a line spectrometer, you can only see one light present.\n- unique spectra: discrete energy levels for atoms are fixed and unique/atom.\n\t- as a result the discrete energy level differences are also fixed and unique to each element.\n\t- each element has difference emission and absorption spectra as the range frequencies of light emitted are based on the discrete energy level differences.\n\t- electrons are quantised (only specific/discrete values are allowed), as in they cannot be between electron energy shells.\n\t\t- the electrons are bumped up/down by absorbing or emitting photon energy.\n- ### problems with bohrs model\n\t- multi-electron atoms\n\t\t- does not work with atoms with 1+ electrons in the valence shell, as it's not possible to calculate all the spectral lines of all other atoms, as this model has classical components (electrostatic attraction)\n\t- relative intensities of spectral lines\n\t\t- the spectral lines are not of equal density\n\t\t- bohrs model doesn't explain why some electron transition would be favoured, and wavelength of light appears more intense in the spectra.\n\t- hyperfine lines\n\t\t- 2 bands contained in a single band\n\t- zeeman effect\n\t\t- when a gas is excited in a magnetic field, emission spectrum shows a splitting of the spectral lines.\n\n# James Chadwick 1932\n- discovered the neutron\n- determined protons made only 1/2 the mass of the atom when he analysed Rutherford's experimental data; specifically the extent and frequency of alpha particle defllection.\n- Thus he believed there was a hidden component of the atom that constituted its remaining mass (50%)\n- ## Experiment\n- in 1932, he discovered that beryllium when bombarded with alpha particles emitted a very energetic stream of radiation, originally thought to be gamma.\n- the properties did not align with gamma rays. it was penetrating alike gamma rays, and it was not deflected upon passing through a magnetic field, therefore it was neutral.\n- radiation when collided with paraffin\n\n# Development of atomic structure\n\nAtomic theory, ancient greeks thought everything was made of a solid matter which cannot be broken down even more\n\nJohn dalton proposed atoms as solid spheres, and there exists different types of spheres for different elements.\n\nJJ Thompson plum pudding model - showed that there exists electrons (negatively charged particles) inside the atom\n\nErnest Rutherford nuclear model, discovered the nucleus, and assumed negative charge surrounds it through the gold leaf experiment, some alpha particles were deflected. Flaw was electron rush into nucleus causing it to collapse\n\nNiels Bohr proposed electron orbit and energy levels of electrons.\n\nGround state blah blah blah\n\n# tl:dr\nlazy fuck\n1. john dalton 1803\n\t1. atomic theory of matter\n\t2. said a lot of wrong shit, but was fundamental to modern atomic theory\n\t3. said\n\t\t1. everything is made up of undivisible particles called atoms\n\t\t2. atoms of different elements have different physical/chemical properties\n\t\t3. atoms of the same elements has the same physical/chemical properties e.g. size n stuff\n\t\t4. atoms cannot be created or destroyed\n\t\t\t1. therefore in a equation the reactants must equal the products\n\t\t5. A chemical reaction involves only separation, combination. Or rearrangement of atoms.\n\t\t6. there exists compounds, which is atoms but in a specific ratio.\n2. jj thomson 1904\n\t1. discovered electrons\n\t2. cathode ray tube experiment\n\t\t1. partially evacuated tube\n\t\t2. cathode and anode on each side\n\t\t3. the tube produces cathode rays (electrons)\n\t\t4. jj thomson discovered that positive magnetic and electric forces deviated the cathode ray towards it.

Sample of the element/compound is introduced to a colourless, non-luminous flame.\n\t- In the experiment, we used ethanol, which was a coloured flame rather than a colourless one. This reduced the accuracy of the experiment and is therefore a systematic error.\n2. As substance is heated, electrons become excited, as they gain energy the electrons can transition into a higher energy state.\n3. Because the electrons are in a higher energy state, they are unstable. So they quickly transition back to their ground state, which emits photons with specific wavelengths (equal to the diff in energy levels)\n4. Therefore, the photons have specific wavelengths, and the specific wavelengths mean specific colours are observed.\n5. Since excited electrons can transition to their ground state in multiple stages, a set of diff photons of diff wavelengths can be emitted.\n\t- This means a spectra of different wavelengths of light is noticed.\n6. This test is only valid for some metals, as most non-metals emit frequencies outside of visible spectrum, and cannot be identified.\n## What can the test be used for\n- Ionic salts: simple ionic solids and metals can be used.\n- Because when heated, the metal ions and anions separate, producing emission within visible spectrum.\n## weaknesses of flame test\n-  the test cannot detect low concentrations of most [ions](notes/archive/AEold/chemistry/lessonnotes/DEFINITIONS.md).\n- salt metal may not be excited by relatively low temperature of the ethanoal flame (magnesium)\n- salt may not be completely excited (diff colour being observed)\n- does not work with most non metals\n- ethanol and oxygen may get involved, changing the observed colour.\n- The brightness of the signal varies from one sample to another. For example, the yellow emission from sodium is much brighter than the red emission from the same amount of lithium.\n- Impurities or contaminants affect the test results. [Sodium](https://www.thoughtco.com/sodium-element-facts-606471), in particular, is present in most compounds and will colour the flame. Sometimes a blue glass is used to filter out the yellow of sodium.\n- The test cannot differentiate between all elements. Several metals produce the same flame colour. Some compounds do not change the colour of the flame at all.\n\nrelated: \n- [atomic structures](notes/archive/AEold/chemistry/lessonnotes/ATOMIC-STRUCTURES.md)\n- [emission spectra](notes/archive/AEold/chemistry/lessonnotes/EMISSION-SPECTRA.md)","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T05:46:50.672891094Z","tags":null},"/notes/archive/AEold/chemistry/lessonnotes/INQ-SKILLS":{"title":"Science Inquiry Skills Definitions","content":"#chemistry #AE #SIS \n- Hypothesis: link between independent and dependent variable, and a prediction on what is going to happen (observation).\n- Independent variable: the variable that is changed, it is the one being investigated.

where the solvent starts\n- solvent front (?) - the distance the solvent travels??? (?)\n- **capillary action** is what draws the solvent up the paper.\n## what\n- less polar substances, the further the substances travels\n## thin layer chromatography\n- all chromatography involves a stationery phase and a mobile phase.\n- in **thin layer chromatography (TLC)**, the stationery phase is a layer of silica gel fixed onto a glass plate.\n- the mobile phase is a solvent which travels up the plate, carrying the substance.\n- TLC use the same principals as paper chromatography.\n- capillary action still draws the solvent up the matrix; however while the molecules in paper chromatography are separated based on mass, in TLC, separation often depends upon solubility or charge, due to the interactions of solute and matrix.\n- a dry sample is placed in the silica gel matrix. As the solvent front moves up the gel, it dissolves the sample and carries it up the matrix with it.\n- some of the particles in the sample stick more strongly to the silica gel than others, so they lag behind the solvent.\n- eventually the different substances in the sample separate out, with similar molecules travelling a similar distance.\n### capillary action of TLC\n- the solvent (i.e. the mobile phase) is drawn up the stationery phase by capillary action.\n- **adhesive forces** are between molecules of different substances. adhesion enables solvent molecules to bond to the stationery phase.\n- **cohesive forces** are between molecules o the same substance. Cohesion enables solvent molecules to bond to each other, and pull each other up to the stationery phase.\n## advantages and disadvantages of TLC and paper chromatography\nadvantages of TLC\n1. the grass is rigid, not flexible like player, so it is easy to control\n2. after separation, the substances in the mixture can be recovered. the silica gel holding the separated substance is scraped off the glass plate and added to a solvent. the substance will dissolve and the silica gel can easily be removed by filtration.\n\t1. the glass plates can be recoated with silica gel and used over and over again.\n1. many substances are white or colourless, and so aren't visible on TLC plate.\n2. one way of making colourless substance show up is use UV light. This usually works well for organic compounds.\n3. an alternative method is to use a chemical locating agent - a chemical that reacts with the substance to form a coloured compound.\n4. for example, when **ninhydrin** is exposed to organic compound, it stains it purple-brown.\n\n## column chromatography\n- ????????????????????????????????????????????????\n\n## gas chromatography\n- gas chromatography has a stationery phase, depends on how strongly it is attracted/absorbed to the surface.\n- gas shouldn't react with any substances in the mixture. non flammable either","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T05:46:50.676891128Z","tags":null},"/notes/archive/AEold/chemistry/notes/mixtures":{"title":"mixtures","content":"\n- solvent, solute, evaporate solvent, and you are left with solute in solid form.\n- difference between evaporation and crystallisation is you can't evaporate solvent until dryness.\n\t- you evaporate to the point of super saturation\n- in crystallisation, you cool your supersaturated solution, to produce crystals.\n- you can have salt that is thermally unstable.\n- issue with ammonium chloride is that it is thermally unstable.\n\t- you cannot use evaporation process for ammonium chloride (since it is thermally unstable -

Describe the valency of an atom as a measure of the atom’s bonding capacity, and use the periodic table to establish the valency of an atom for periods 1 to 3. \n\t- p1: valency of +1\n\t- p2: valency of +2\n\t- p3: valency of +3\n\t- idk what this objective means\n1. Explain how the ability of atoms to form chemical bonds is related to its electronic structure, particularly the stability of the valence shell. \n\t- why do atoms form chemical bonds?\n\t\t- to achieve stability where a valence shell is full.\n\t- what are the 4 structures of chemical arrangements?\n\t\t- giant metallic\n\t\t\t- what is giant metallic structure?\n\t\t\t\t- lattice consists of regularly arranged ions (not atoms), surrounded by a sea of delocalised electrons. \n\t\t\t\t- the outer electrons are free to move around the positive metal ions formed\n\t\t- giant ionic\n\t\t\t- strong electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged ions.\n\t\t- giant molecular\n\t\t\t- what is giant molecular structure?\n\t\t\t\t- large number of atoms are joined by covalent bonds\n\t\t- simple molecular\n\t\t\t- what is a simple molecular structure?\n\t\t\t\t- contains only a few atoms held together by covalent bonds. ie CO2\n\t\t\t\t- there exists weaker intermolecular forces between atoms.\n3. Explain how electrostatic attraction between oppositely charges species / regions leads to chemical bonds. \n\t- two oppositely charged species leads to an electrostatic attraction as the metal loses electrons to become a positive ion, and the non-metal gain the electrons lost by the metal to become a negative ion. \n4. Use the periodic table to establish the type of bonding present in elements and compounds. \n\t- what are the types of bonding?\n\t\t- metallic: metal + metal\n\t\t- ionic: non metal + metal\n\t\t- covalent: non metal + non metal\n1. Explain why the type of bonding present in a substance defines the physical properties of that substance, including melting and boiling points, conductivity of heat and electricity, and hardness. \n\t- covalent network: \n\t\t- very high melting boiling point\n\t\t- mostly not conductive\n\t\t- mostly hard and brittle \n\t- ionic\n\t\t- high melting boiling point\n\t\t- conductors (in molten or dissolved in water, otherwise non-conductors)\n\t\t- hard and brittle\n\t- metallic\n\t\t- mostly moderate to high melting point\n\t\t- conductive\n\t\t- malleable and ductile\n\t- covalent molecular\n\t\t- low melting boiling point\n\t\t- non conductors\n\t\t- soft\n### Ionic Bonding \n45. Define ions as atoms or groups of atoms that are electrically charged due to loss or gain of electrons. \n\t- ion is an atom or a group of atoms that has are electrically charged.\n\t\t- this is due to a loss or gain of electrons.\n\t- atoms/groups of atoms which have lost an electron is called a cation (positively charged ion)\n\t- atoms/groups of atoms which have gained an electron is called an anion (negatively charged ion)\n46. Describe and explain how ions are held together to form an ionic lattice. \n\t- due to **strong electrostatic attraction** between neighbouring **positive** and **negative** ions.\n\t- any given positive ion is attracted to all surrounding negative ions and vice versa.\n\t\t- there also exists repulsive forces, but they are much weaker as the **like** (same force) charged ions are further apart in the lattice (diagonally arranged) than the adjacent **unlike** charged ions. \n\t\t- electrostatic force **reduce** considerable as the distance between ions **increases**.\n47. Use understanding of ionic bonding to explain the physical properties of ionic compounds, including: \n\t1. High melting and boiling points \n\t\t- ionic bonds are strong electrostatic attractive forces between ions. These strong attractive forces extend throughout the ionic lattice keeping individual ions in fixed positions. \n\t\t- Thus a high temperature, ie high particle kinetic energy, is needed to disrupt (melt) the ionic lattice.\n\t2. Hardness and brittleness \n\t\t- if a large force is applied to the ionic lattice it will cause layers of ions to move.\n\t\t- when this happens, like charged ions will be forced to align alongside one another, ie no longer diagonally aligned.\n\t\t- this means **like** charges will be closer together than **unlike** charges. \n\t\t- consequently **repulsive forces** will exceed **attractive forces** and the lattice will break apart rather than simply dent or bend.\n\t3. Conductivity in solid, liquid and aqueous states. \n\t\t- solid - poor conductors\n\t\t\t- in an ionic solid the ions are tightly held in **fixed positions**. Thus they are **unable to move** and **carry charge**.\n\t\t\t- an **absence** of **mobile** charged particles means ionic solids are not-conductors of electricity.\n\t\t- molten (liquid) - good conductors\n\t\t\t- in molten phase, ions are mobile and free to move and carry charge throughout the ionic liquid.\n\t\t\t- since both positive and negative ions **carry charge**, positive ions move towards the negative electrode while negative ions move towards the positive electrode.\n\t\t- aqueous - good conductors\n\t\t\t- individual ions from the ionic solid are mobile and free to move independently of one another.\n\t\t\t- their mobility and charge enable them to conduct an electric current through the ionic solution.\n\t\t\t- the current consists of positive ions moving toward the negative electrode and negative ions moving towards the positive electrode.\n48. Calculate percentage composition of an ionic compound from the relative atomic masses of the constituent species. \n\t- ![300](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020230427182727.png)\n49. Define and describe the difference between anhydrous and hydrated salts, and explain the role of water of crystallisation. \n\t- what is anhydrous salt?\n\t\t- a compound in which all water is removed.\n\t- what is a hydrated salt?\n\t\t- a salt molecule that is attached to a certain number of water molecules.\n50. Calculate the formula of an ionic compound from empirical data, including the formula of a hydrated salt. \n\t- how do you use the handy table?\n\t\t- |     | $CaCl$    | $H_2O$    |\n\t\t| --- | ------- | ------- |\n\t\t|   mass | 3.333   | 3.24    |\n\t\t|   Mr  | 110.98  | 18.016  |\n\t\t|  moles   | 0.03003 | 0.17984 |\n\t\t| ratio    | 1       | 5.986   |\n2. Perform stoichiometric calculations in order to establish percentage composition and empirical formula of ionic compounds.\n\t- real\n### Metallic Bonding \n52. Describe how metallic bonding holds metal atoms together, in a lattice of positively charged ions surrounded by delocalised electrons. \n\t- whats in a metallic lattice?\n\t\t- atoms achieve noble gas electron configuration by releasing their valence electrons. the positive metal ions occupy fixed positions within a 3d lattice, whilst valence electrons are free to move at random amongst lattice of metal ions. \n\t\t- what is the electrons called\n\t\t\t- delocalised\n\t\t- what are the electrons described to be\n\t\t\t- mobile sea of electrons\n1. Explain the physical properties of metals, including: \n\t- a. malleability and ductility \n\t\t- why is metallic bonds malleable and ductile?\n\t\t\t- bonding is **non-directional**, so it means that metal atoms can move in relation to each other without breaking bonds between them and the sea of electrons.\n\t\t\t- when a metal changes shape, ie to be dented, bent or stretched, it will not break.\n\t- b. thermal and electrical conductivity \n\t\t- why are metals good at conducting electricity?\n\t\t\t- because its electrons are delocalised.\n\t\t\t- if voltage is applied, electrons move towards the positive terminal of power supply.\n\t\t- whys it good at conducting heat?\n\t\t\t- delocalised electrons are mobile so can carry heat (as kinetic energy)\n\t- c. generally high melting and boiling points. \n\t\t- strong attractive forces between the metal ions and sea of electrons hold the metallic lattice together.\n### Covalent Bonding \n54. Describe a covalent bond as a shared pair of electrons, resulting in electrostatic attraction between positive nuclei of the atoms and the shared electron pair. \n\t- how to describe covalent bond?\n\t\t- covalent bonds are two non metallic atoms which share electrons, so the electrostatic attraction exists between the nucleus and their individual electrons and the electrons they share. (?)\n1. Draw Lewis structures for covalent molecules, showing both bonding pairs and lone pairs of electrons. \n\t- how to draw lewis structure diagram \n\t- ![300](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020230427092439.png)\n2. Use the valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory along with Lewis structures to explain, predict and draw the shapes of molecules and polyatomic ions. \n\t- ![300](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020230427184104.png)\n3. Explain the physical properties of covalent molecular substances, including: \n\t- a. low melting and boiling points \n\t\t- why does covalent molecular substances have low melting and boiling points?\n\t\t\t- only the weak intermolecular forces of the bond needs to be overcome.\n\t\t\t- therefore, it is easily disrupted by heat energy.\n\t\t\t\t- (covalent bonds are occurring within the atoms, not the molecules, therefore there are no strong covalent bonds holding atoms together)\n\t- b. non-conductivity \n\t\t- why is covalent molecular substances non conductive?\n\t\t\t- protons and electrons occupy fixed positions, so electrons are not delocalised and free moving. \n\t\t\t- in other words, the electrons are localised.\n\t- c. softness and brittleness. \n\t\t- why it soft and brittle?\n\t\t\t- there are no covalent bonds **between** atoms, only **within** atoms.\n\t\t\t- therefore, only weak intermolecular forces (dispersion) needs to be overcome to break apart the covalent molecular structure.\n\t\t\t- so molecules are easily separated from one another.\n4. Recognise some common covalent network substances, including diamond, graphite and silicon dioxide. \n\t- What has a higher boiling point: covalent network substances or covalent molecular substances in the same period.\n\t\t- Covalent network substances because it is purely covalent bonds.\n5. Describe the range of allotropes of elemental carbon (diamond, graphite and fullerenes), and explain why they have significantly different physical and chemical properties. \n\t- diamond:\n\t\t- 4 covalent bonds\n\t- graphite:\n\t\t- 3 covalent bonds, stacked on each other and attracted together with dispersion forces\n\t- fullernes:\n\t\t- buckyball, 60 carbons in the shape of a ball.\n1. Explain the physical properties of covalent network substances, including: \n\t- a. high melting and boiling points \n\t- b. hardness and brittleness \n\t\t- strong covalent bonds occur so it is very hard.\n\t\t- however, it is brittle, because distortion causes the structure to be damaged, and the protons will repel other protons, \n\t- c. thermal conductivity \n\t\t- does not conduct heat, because electrons are in fixed positions\n\t- d. electrical conductivity \n\t\t- does not conduct electric, because electrons are in fixed positions\n### Nanomaterials \n61. Describe what nanomaterials are. \n       - nanomaterials are materials which have at least one dimension in the **1-100 nanometre** range. (1 nanometre = $1\\times 10^{-9}$ metres).\n       - nanomaterials differ from the bulk of the material it is made from.\n63. State and describe how the properties of nanomaterials may differ from the properties of the bulk material, and give examples. \n\t- why it differs?\n\t\t- many are due to quantum effects that result from their small particle size\n\t\t- eg zinc oxide and titanium are white opaque solids with good UV protection. in macro particle form, it leaves a layer on the skin.\n\t\t\t- so nano particles become invisible on the skin whilst protecting against UV exposure.\n1. Identify uses of nanomaterials and suggest advantages and disadvantages to their use. \n\t- \n2. Describe the potential health risks associated with the use of nanoparticles. (SHE) \n\t- hazardous when inhaled for workers exposed to some airborne nanoparticles.\n3. Describe and explain examples of environmental concerns associated with the use of nanomaterials. (SHE)\n\t- not much is known about environment\n4. Provide a balanced discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of nanomaterials. (SHE) \n### Intermolecular Forces \n67. Describe the difference between intramolecular bonding and intermolecular forces. \n\t- Two bondings exist in a molecular substance.\n\t- Intramolecular forces are the strongest of the two bonds. \n\t\t- These are the bonds that exists **within** molecules **between** atoms.\n\t\t- essentially keeps the atoms clustered together within a molecule.\n\t\t- thee covalent bonds are not affected during melting, boiling or evaporating. \n\t\t\t- only chemical changes affect these bonds.\n\t- Intermolecular forces are much weaker.\n\t\t- **occur within** molecules, bonding between **molecules**\n\t\t- much easier to overcome when a molecular substance **melts**, **boils**, or **evaporates**.\n\t\t- three types of intermolecular forces.\n\t\t\t- **dispersion**\n\t\t\t\t- occur in all molecular materials\n\t\t\t\t- however, it is the only intermolecular forces of attraction present in non-polar substances like hydrocarbons and gases like N2, O2, and CO2\n\t\t\t\t- generally increases in strength with number of electrons.\n\t\t\t\t\t- clearly seen in non-polar, alkane family of compounds\n\t\t\t\t\t\t- boiling point increases with increasing molar mass.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- because of this property, it is often stated that dispersion forces increase with molar mass / molecular size\n\t\t\t\t- dispersion forces are stronger in molecules with shapes allowing maximum surface contact between molecules, ie linear in preference to branched or spherical shapes.\n\t\t\t\t\t- thus linear molecules will have stronger dispersion forces and hence higher melting points and boiling points than spherical or branched shapes of similar mass.\n\t\t\t\t- dispersion force arise when random motion of electrons produce short lived **temporary dipoles**.\n\t\t\t\t\t- this makes non-polar molecules temporarily polar.\n\t\t\t\t\t- cause nearby molecules to form similar temporary dipoles called **induced dipoles**.\n\t\t\t\t\t- temporary dipole and induced dipole experience weak electrostatic known as **dispersion forces**. \n\t\t\t\t\t- these forces constantly change due to temporary and induced dipoles being constantly formed, rapidly disappearing and then reforming elsewhere.\n\t\t\t- **dipole-dipole**\n\t\t\t\t- polar (see notes on [polarity](notes/archive/AEold/chemistry/notes/polarity.md)) molecules attract one another due to weak electrostatic attraction between their dipoles.\n\t\t\t\t- dipole dipole forces **increase melting points and boiling points**.\n\t\t\t\t\t- because of this, substances with polar molecules have slightly higher melting and boiling points than other substances of similar molecular size.\n\t\t\t\t- generally substances with dipole-dipole forces, ie polar ones, will be soluble in one another but not soluble in non-polar substances, ie ones that can't interact by dipole-dipole forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t- this is why ethanol (polar) and water (polar) are soluble in one another, but mineral turpentine (non-polar) isn't soluble in water.\n\t\t\t\t- ability to dissolve ionic solutes.\n\t\t\t\t- this property is due to attraction between the dipole of a polar molecule and an ion's charge. \n\t\t\t\t\t- called ion-dipole forces, not a type of intermolecular forces.\n\t\t\t- **hydrogen bond**\n\t\t\t\t- **directional** intermolecular forces. (? what does that mean)\n\t\t\t\t- only exists between molecules having Hydrogen-F/O/N arrangement of atoms.\n\t\t\t\t- due to electrostatic attraction between a **lone pair** of electrons (negative) of a F, O, or N atom and an H atom already covalently bonded to another F, O or N atom.\n\t\t\t\t- sometimes described as extreme dipole-dipole attraction, where strong positive dipole of an H atom, ie one bonded to a highly electronegative F, O or N atom, is attracted to a strongly negatively dipole of another F, O or N atom.\n\t\t\t\t- can be part of the same molecule or from different molecules.\n\t\t\t\t- **melting and boiling points** are much **higher** for substances that can hydrogen bond than for those of similar molecular size that cannot hydrogen bond.\n\t\t\t\t- solubility is also affected - substances experiencing hydrogen bonding between molecules are **extremely soluble** in other substances which are also hydrogen bonded.\n1. Compare the relative strength of ionic, covalent and metallic bonding with intermolecular forces. \n\t- intermolecular forces are relatively **weaker** than intramolecular forces (ionic, covalent, metallic)\n2. Recognise that intermolecular forces are present in all substances, but are most significant in discussion of the properties of covalent molecular substances, due to the lack of any stronger interactions between molecules. \n\t- why is intermolecular forces present in all substances?\n\t\t- because of dispersion force\n\t\t- it arises when the random motion of electrons within a molecule produce short lived **temporary dipoles** (makes non-polar molecules temporarily polar)\n\t\t- polar molecules cause nearby molecules to form similar temporary dipoles called **induced dipoles**\n\t\t- these dipoles create temporary and weak electrostatic attraction called dispersion.\n\t\t- rapid state of change - constantly form, disappear and reform.\n1. Describe how dispersion forces arise in all substances, and explain how molecular shape, and number of atoms affect the strength of dispersion forces. \n\t- dispersion force arises in all substances because of random electron movements called **temporary dipoles**\n\t- the temporary dipoles create **induced dipoles**, and they form temporary intermolecular forces called dispersion force.\n\t- more electron and more surface contact has stronger dispersion forces.\n\t\t- linear \u003e branched or spherical shapes.\n1. Use knowledge of electronegativity to establish bond polarity. \n\t- what is bond polarity?\n\t\t- difference in electronegativity\n2. Use understanding of molecular shape, bond polarity and symmetry to establish and explain the polarity of molecules. \n\t- \n3. Describe how dipole-dipole forces arise, and explain how the relative size of a molecular dipole affects the strength of dipole-dipole forces. \n\t- f\n4. Describe how hydrogen bonding arises, end explain why this special case of dipole-dipole bonding is so much stronger than other examples of dipole-dipole bonding. \n5. Draw diagrams to show how all types of intermolecular forces occur between neighbouring molecules. \n6. Compare the relative strength of the types of intermolecular forces. \n\t- order in strength?\n\t\t- strongest is ion-dipole\n\t\t- hydrogen bonding\n\t\t- dipole dipole\n\t\t- dispersion forces\n7. Use understanding of bond polarity, molecular shape and symmetry to establish the nature and strength of intermolecular forces present in a covalent molecular substance. \n8. Explain how the physical properties of covalent molecular substances depend on the strength of intermolecular forces, including: \n\t- a. melting and boiling point \n\t\t- trend?\n\t\t\t- increases with intermolecular force strength\n\t\t- why trend occur?\n\t\t\t- because boiling point and melting point describes the energy required to break the IMF within molecules. \n\t\t- what is the relation to different intermolecular forces?\n\t\t\t- dispersion\n\t\t\t\t- all molecules have dispersion forces, for molecules with only dispersion forces present, as dispersion forces increase in strength, so would boiling and melting point.\n\t\t\t- dipole-dipole\n\t\t\t\t- substances with dipole-dipole will have slightly higher melting + boiling point than substances of similar molecular size that can't interact this way\n\t\t\t- hydrogen bonding\n\t\t\t\t- substances with hydrogen bonding will have high melting + boiling points than substances of similar molecular size (that can't hydrogen bond)\n\t- b. vapour pressure \n\t\t- what is vapour pressure?\n\t\t\t- tendency of substance to evaporate\n\t\t- what is vapour pressure measured in?\n\t\t\t- kPa\n\t\t- how does a substance evaporate?\n\t\t\t- it must escape the intermolecular forces keeping it in liquid phase.\n\t\t- what does this mean?\n\t\t\t- thus weak intermolecular forces = easily evaporate = high vapour pressure\n\t\t- trend with temperature and evaporation\n\t\t\t- all substances have greater temp \u003e increase vapour pressure.\n\t\t\t- why is this the case?\n\t\t\t\t- high temp = higher avg molecular kinetic energies\n\t- c. solubility in water and organic solvents \n\t\t- usually strength of solubility needs to be **comparable in strength** for the solvent and the solute.\n\t\t- this means that non-polar molecules, ie those with dispersion forces can be dissolved in other non-polar substances that also attract strongly by dispersion force.\n\t\t\t- however these substances won't be soluble in polar substances whose molecules attract strongly by dipole-dipole forces.\n\t\t- also the case for hydrogen bonding, where compounds that attract strongly by hydrogen bonding are extremely soluble in other compounds that also attract strongly by hydrogen bonding.\n9.

'Where the Crawdads Sing' is an American mystery and detective fiction film directed by Olivia Newman from a screenplay by Lucy Alibar based on the book written by Delia Owens of the same name. The film explores themes of isolation and violence. The story follows Kya, a girl who spends most of her life alone in the marsh due to rejection by society, who winds up being the primary suspect of a murder case. Kya's \"righteous\" motive draws similarities to Owens' personal experiences, in which the death of multiple animal poachers is allegedly the fault of Owens. Through the understanding of the film and its context I as the contemporary audience develop an empathetic but critical response to the actions of the murderer.\n\n## Body Paragraph 1\n- characterisation: the characterisation of Kya, a nature loving independent and isolated girl who will do anything to achieve her goals, including murder, parallels Delia Owens, a nature loving conservationist who would protect against poachers at any cost.\n- both characters are strong female heroines.\n- this developed my response of appreciation of their resolve to protect their peace and isolation at any cost, but im critical towards the fact they value the upkeep of nature to a human life, and their view that you can only have one, but not the other.\n## Body Paragraph 2\n- environment: the large marsh which sees more animals than humans is parallel to the environment of zambia which mark and delia owens lived.\n- like how delia adored africa, kya adored the marsh, both appreciating the solitude and isolation it provides, as well how the nature in it functions.\n- this constructs my response to understand that the environment can change the direction of a moral compass. people raised in normal society, who interacts with other humans values lives over anything else, but the marsh and african environment, in which perpetual life cycles of living and dying could be found anywhere and everywhere allows me to understand why kya and delia owens appreciate the company of animals, and do not put a higher value on human lives as others do.\n## Body Paragraph 3\n- values of murder: kya and delia owens, under the impact of environment and characterisation, both view murder as a \"way of life\".\n- kya doesn't hesitate in murdering chase andrews, and manages to elaborately set up a plan and execute it to perfection, whilst delia owens allows and actively trains game scouts to take down and capture poachers with her husband and son mark and christopher owens.\n\n## conclusion\n- R\n\t- I as the audience develop an empathetic but critical response to the actions of Kya.\n- I\n\t- \n- P\n\t- Owens effectively portrays Kya as a character to feel empathetic towards. It is significant for authors to allow the reader to believe in the protagonist, so the protagonist resonates with the reader. Owens effectively does this \n\n** treat Kya as a character in a story. Not as an actual person. \n******** focus on the how of Kya's portrayal - is it through metalanguage, dialogue, narration **what** does the narrator use to assist him in portraying Kya?","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T05:46:50.676891128Z","tags":null},"/notes/archive/AEold/english/WTCS-PRAC2":{"title":"WTCS-PRAC2","content":"\n1.     Discuss how your attitudes influence your response to the way a controversy is represented in at least one text.\n\nResponses are affected by the reader’s attitudes and how the text conveys certain ideas, such as if the text establishes context. This is underlined in the film “Where the Crawdads Sing” (2022) directed by Olivia Newman from screenplay by Lucy Alibar adapted from the novel of the same name. The film follows a coming-of-age story of an isolated girl named Kya, who is raised in the marsh and is suspected of the murder of a man she was once romantically involved with. My attitudes as the contemporary audience towards ideas of discrimination, isolation and relationships influence my response and positions me to be empathetic towards Kya in the representation of a murder case as the controversy.\n\nAs the contemporary attitude, my critical attitude towards discrimination influences my response to be condemning towards the accusation and the townspeople, believing they are motivated by prejudice and bias common in 1950s America rather than justice. The prejudice against Kya is highlighted with the townspeople always referring to Kya as “the marsh girl.” This label marks Kya as nothing other than her origins, something she cannot change. The label placed on Kya is similar to slurs against people based on their origin that is now shunned in contemporary society. The societal criticism of discrimination is much more different than 1950s America, where there are less consequences and seen as less serious. This labelling of Kya based on her origins, something she cannot change, influences my response to be empathetic towards Kya when she is accused of murder. [evidence 2, elaboration 2 goes here]. [link goes here]\n\nMy response to the representation of the controversy of the murder is influenced by my solemn (?) attitude towards isolation. Kya, ever since a young age has experienced isolation, not at her own fault, but the situation she was born in led eventually to her entire family one after the other abandoning the marsh, and consequentially, Kya (too long how to shorten). Kya reflects on this by stating that she “had a family once” who “called [her] Kya.” The use of past tense in “once” and “called” shows that Kya no longer has a family, nor does she have someone who calls by her real name, highlighting her loss of identity as Kya, and is now seen more as a “marsh girl” (should’ve used this for BP1 lmao). This is significant in influencing my response, as when she was revealed to be the murderer, my attitudes towards isolation influences my response to be empathetic, as the isolation she experienced and her exposure to the nature may present Kya a different viewpoint on life and death than everybody else, seeing it as an eventual constant rather than something to grieve over. [link and more bps here]\n\nFurthermore, my response to the murder case is influenced by my attitude towards relationships, in which I believe personal connection is an essential need contemporary context, in which social media and the growing connection with the technological word has led to a time where society is embedded more in social connection than any other time period of history. This is evidenced when Kya begged Tate to “please stay”, as she does not want to experience isolation again. In the contemporary context, where social media and every day the world gets more connected online, my attitude on social connection is that it is a basic human necessity and something everyone wishes to attain. This attitude further develops my empathy towards Kya in the trial, as she did not have the human connections relative to everybody else to learn what is socially acceptable and rather her environment of the marsh has shaped her character and perspective on life. When Tate doesn’t come back when he promised, Kya came to the realisation that “people don’t stay”, and she “had to do life alone” this shows although Kya wishes for social connection, those who are close to her consistently abandoned her eventually, to a point she feels she naturally undeserving of companionship (quote should go here). My attitude on the necessity of social connection furthers my empathetic response towards Kya. Hence, through my contemporary attitude on the necessity of social connection my response is empathetic towards Kya’s situation, because people she had connections with eventually abandoned her. (maybe unneeded last part)\n\nAs a contemporary reader, my attitudes on discrimination, isolation and social connection influences my response to be overall empathetic towards Kya. My critical attitude on discrimination, solemn attitude towards isolation, and the attitude on social connection, viewing it as a basic necessity everyone wishes to attain, all influences my response to be empathetic towards Kya. The portrayal of Kya as innocent and empathised towards the contemporary audience is significant in establishing that contextual information and backstory may change the perception and response by readers.\n\nGeneral observations\n\n-       Very very weak evidence, not enough ratio in terms of evidence to analysis. (what is the correct evidence analysis ratio?)\n\n-       Elaboration too complex and repetitive maybe.\n\n-       Needs link\n\n-       Expand body paragraphs 1,2\n\n-       Topic ideas are less overarching and seemingly develops as the essay develops rather than an umbrella concept (idk if this makes sense)\n\n-       Empathetic response is overused (used for all of them), maybe think of something else.\n\n-       Identifying main points in conclusion seems kind of weak\n\n-       Weak pointing of significance of tet\n\nExplain how at least one text conforms to generic conventions while still challenging its audience.\n\nFollowing conventions of genres is important, but to be distinct and create a piece of media that offers a new perspective, texts should subvert areas of genre to bring on new ideas. The 2022 film “Where the Crawdads Sing” directed by Olivia Newman from screenplay by Lucy Alibar based on 2018 novel of the same name my Delia Owens challenges and subverts the detective fiction genre and ideas surrounding it. The film follows the coming-of-age story of a girl raised in the marsh called Kya, who is suspected to be the murderer of someone who she was once romantically involved with. The text although conforming to certain ideas of the detective fiction genre, such as creating characters common within a detective fiction and following a common structure of a detective fiction, as more information is revealed to the audience as the story progresses, subverts and challenges the protagonist not being actively involved in solving the murder, and rejecting the traditional detective fiction ending to challenge or surprised the audience.\n\n“Where the Crawdads Sing” conforms to the detective fiction genre through generic conventions of characterisation but subverts and challenges the audience by making the protagonist not involved with solving the murder, but the suspect. The victim of the story is Chase Andrews, and the film conforms to the detective fiction genre by describing the details and specificity of his death, whilst also providing information on Chase Andrews, such as describing him as “the star quarterback of town” through an alternative timeline of the past which the film switches between. The characterisation of the victim and providing details similar to other detective fiction allows the contemporary audience a chance to figure out the mystery using provided clues to race against detectives and police officers in the novel. However, the text challenges the detective fiction genre by characterising Kya as not a prodigy or wise detective, but a young girl who is suspected of the crime. This challenges the traditional detective fiction approach, in which the protagonist is often a young prodigy or old experienced eccentric detective. This challenges the audience expectations, as although giving a greater insight to what happened, the recollections of the past may be from an unreliable narrator, which subverts from the standard of how detective cases are presented for the audience to solve, in which detectives can make more unbiased judgements. Thus, through the text’s utilisation of characterisation, “Where the Crawdads Sing” conforms to the detective fiction’s characterisation of the victim by developing his backstory and details of death but subverts and challenges the contemporary audience by making the protagonist the suspect rather than the detective.\n\nFurthermore, the text utilises narrative conventions of plot to conform to the detective fiction genre through following a linear storyline in relation to time and reveals more information and clues as the story progresses, but challenges audiences and expectations by rejecting the traditional ending within detective fiction to surprise the audience. The film switches back and forth between two-time periods of before the murder occurred, from when Kya was a child, and the aftermath, in which Kya was held at trial. The film uses the past to provide contextual information and clues on the murder, whilst the trial shows the ongoing decision that the jury will come to. This format allows the audience to intake information as film progress and allow them to make an educated decision on what the cause of the death of Chase Andrews was, which conforms to the detective fiction genre which slowly displaces clues and information about the case before the detective comes to a final conclusion, finding the murderer, or in this case determining if the suspect is guilty or not. However, the text subverts expectations by not revealing the actual murder, but instead hints in the ending that Kya was the one who did it, with her leaving a letter of confession right before passing away. This is different from traditional detective fiction endings, in which justice is served to the criminal, and everyone gets a happy ending. This challenges the audience to feel outraged at the fact that the murderer wasn’t condemned, unlike other detective fiction tales. Hence, through the employment of narrative conventions of plot, the detective fiction generic convention of slowly revealing clues as the story progresses is conformed, but challenges the audience when Kya was revealed to be the murderer, and the audience discovers that justice was not served.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Where the Crawdads Sing\" directed by Olivia Newman from screenplay by Lucy Alibar based on 2018 novel of the same name by Delia Owens subverts and challenges the traditional ideas surrounding the detective fiction genre. While conforming to certain conventions of the genre, the film challenges the protagonist's passive role in solving the murder and rejects the typical detective fiction ending to surprise and challenge the audience. By doing so, the film offers a unique perspective on justice and the criminal justice system. This text ultimately highlights the importance of challenging and subverting traditional ideas and genres to offer new and unique perspectives on familiar concepts.\n\nideas\n\n-       Human connection \u0026 independence\n\no   “please stay”\n\n§  Kya begs of Tate to “please stay”, highlighting her inner yearning for human connection and companionship. The desire for emotional support and closeness is further emphasised by the desperation in her voice and the vulnerability in her body language.\n\no   “I don’t know if anyone really knows me”.\n\n§  Kya states that she doesn’t know “if anybody really knows [her]”. This expresses her isolation and feeling disconnected with everything around her and reveals Kya’s doubts on if there is anybody out there who understands her.\n\no   “I had to do life alone… people don’t stay”.\n\n§  Kya reflects on her experience of abandonment by stating that she “had to do life alone”, and people in her life “don’t stay”. This statement highlights Kya’s loneliness and her struggles to form lasting connections with others. Her innate realisation people don’t stay suggest a sense of despair, and that all her life she never had the chance to experience a lasting human connection.\n\n-       Prejudice\n\no   “They call you the marsh girl…where you been, marsh hen?... where’s your hat swamp rat?”\n\n§  Marsh girl, marsh hen, swamp rat\n\n§  Throughout the story, Kya is subjected to ridicule and ostracism because of her isolation and poverty, as evidenced when the townspeople use derogatory names such as “marsh girl”, “marsh hen”, and “swamp rat.” These epithets reduce Kya’s identity to a mere label and reinforces the idea that she is inferior to others, and does not deserve formal education, respect or dignity.\n\no   “I never hated them, they hated me.”\n\n§  Kya stating that she “never hated them”, but “they hated” her highlights that although she was ostracised and judged by the people of her community because of her isolation and poverty, she never harboured any hate towards them, but is instead the victim of prejudice, underscoring the ways discrimination can harm those who did nothing wrong.\n\no   “They’re not deciding anything about me. It’s them. They are judging themselves.”\n\n§  Kya reflects on the ostracization she received and determined that the prejudice against her isn’t “deciding anything about” her, but instead the townspeople are “judging themselves.” She recognises that that townspeople judgement and prejudice are saying more about themselves than they are about her. This characterisation shows Kya’s developed self-acceptance, in which Kya is able to find resilience in the face of adversity.\n\n-       Nature // The marsh\n\no   “It’s like having a friend your whole life but you never see their face”.\n\n§  Kya's statement, \"It's like having a friend your whole life but you never see their face\" highlights the power of nature and the deep connection that individuals can feel with their surroundings. Kya has grown up in the marsh, where she has developed a profound bond with the natural world around her. Her statement suggests that this connection is as deep and meaningful as a friendship, despite the fact that it does not involve human interaction.\n\no   “the only constant in nature is change”\n\n§  In Where the Crawdads Sing, the statement \"the only constant in nature is change\" reflects the idea that everything in the natural world is subject to transformation and evolution. This statement is particularly significant for Kya, who has grown up in the marsh and has developed a deep understanding of the natural world around her. Her experiences have taught her that the environment is constantly shifting and adapting, and that individuals must be willing to accept and adapt to these changes.\n\no   “the marsh knows all about death.”\n\n§  In Where the Crawdads Sing, the statement \"the marsh knows all about death\" reflects the idea that nature is intimately connected with the cycle of life and death. Kya has grown up in the marsh, and is disconnected from her community, so she has developed a deep understanding of the natural world around her. Her experiences have taught her that death is a natural and necessary part of life, and that the marsh is both a site of birth and of decay.\n\nExplore how at least one text reveals that the values and attitudes of an individual or group are shaped by their circumstances.\n\nStylistic choices -\u003e genre\n\nLanguage features -\u003e film conventions","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T05:46:50.676891128Z","tags":null},"/notes/archive/AEold/english/WTCS-THE-OTHER":{"title":"WTCS-THE-OTHER","content":"\n# the concept of the other\n- broad term that refers to individuals or groups who are been seen on the margins.\n- outside of mainstream or what is considered normal\n- the other is usually represented as different, but as inferior, less powerful and worthy.\n- kya for example is represented as someone who the townspeople think doesn't deserve compassion, education or a family.\n# relation to values and attitudes and ideologies.\n- for example in western society, we value and respect others, need a job to work hard and make money, and value ideas about family and education.\n# binary oppositions\n- sense of self and other are binary oppositions.\n- the self and the other are social constructs that involve a power difference. \n# politics\n- rapid changes in technology and social demographics through migration and globalisation has redefined dominant culture and what it means to be a member of mainstream media.\n# how to construct others\n- others are often people who are romanticised, feared, stereotyped or pitied - someone who is different.\n- kya is WTCS is feared, pitied, excluded and scorned.\n# gender\n- the idea of an independent female, rare in the  1960s leads to kya being see as an other, as she is different from other women of the same time period.\n# outsiders\n- outsider is a popular character type who is earned by those who exist outside the norm of dominant spheres of identity.","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T05:46:50.676891128Z","tags":null},"/notes/archive/AEold/english/WTCS-VALUES-ATTITUDES":{"title":"WTCS-VALUES-ATTITUDES","content":"# values and attitudes\n- values and attitudes are embedded in texts (visual, written and multimodal texts)\n- values are what individuals or groups think are important and hold to be worth (e.g. justice, honesty, education)\n- dominant values are those values that are widely shared among a group, community, or culture in a particular context.\n- attitudes are the positions held or responses an individual or group make, as a result of their values.

initial velocities $v_{avg}=\\frac{1}{2}(v+u)$\n\t- $\\frac{s}{t}=\\frac{1}{2}(v+u)$\n\t- $s=\\frac{1}{2}(v+u)t$ (whoa an equation of motion, derived from simple formulas)\n- we know displacement is the area of a velocity time graph, which can be represented as $s=ut+\\frac{1}{2}(v-u)\\times t$\n\t- we also know that $a=\\frac{{v-u}}{t}$\n\t- such $s=ut+\\frac{1}{2}\\times a\\times t\\times t=ut+\\frac{1}{2}at^2$\n### vertical motion and gravity\n- acceleration is 9.80m\n- substitute for equations of motion.\n- that's it.\n### newton's three laws of motion\n#### force preface\n force can be thought of as push or pull\n- forces that directly act upon a body are called **contact forces**, because the force is only experienced when contact is maintained. \n\t- forces acted upon the body at a distance are **non-contact** forces.\n- a force is measured in newtons\n#### 1. an object in motion stays in motion (maintain constant velocity) unless an unbalanced, external force acts upon it (the object).\n- the term **maintains a constant velocity** implies that, if the object is moving, then it will continue to move with a velocity that has the same magnitude and direction. e.g. a car moving 12m/s south after a set amount of time will still be moving at 12m/s (this is also consistent with zero velocity)\n- **unless** implies an otherwise for the non-continuation of a constant velocity, and is shown through an **unbalanced** acting force.\n- terminal velocity is the state of time when the speed a skydiver falls is equal to the air resistance, such the skydiver is unable to gain acceleration without changing anything such as mass or shape.\n- ##### inertia\n\t- the law is expanded upon with inertia.\n\t- inertia is considered to be the resistance to a change in motion of an object.\n\t- as the mass of an object increases, inertia increases.\n\t- inertia causes:\n\t\t- harder to start moving a stationery object.\n\t\t- harder to stop moving a object with a velocity.\n\t\t- harder to change the direction of motion.\n\t\t- this can be demonstrated in real life through shopping carts.\n#### 2. force = mass x acceleration\n- connects mass, acceleration and forces\n- newtons 2nd law can be edited to fit with change in momentum\n- since $a=\\frac{v-u}{\\Delta t},F=m \\frac{v-u}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t}$\n#### 3. every force has an equal and opposing force.\n- when hammer hits nail, the nail and the hammer both experience forces.\n\t- the force experienced by hammer is relative to the force experienced by the nail.\n\t- this observation follows newton's third law. stating every force has an equal and opposing force.\n- in a collision of a large bus and a small car, the force both experiences are the same.\n\t- but due to the difference in mass, one has a higher acceleration, whilst the other has a lower acceleration.\n- this is true for gravity as well - called the normal force.\n\t- abbreviated as $F_{N}$ or $N$\n### free body diagram  \n### applying the relationship F=ma and Fweight=mg using free body diagrams.\n## momentum\n- p=mv where p is momentum (kgm/s), m is mass of object (kg), v is velocity of object (m/s)\n### conservation of momentum (1d collisions)\n- $\\sum p_{before}=\\sum p_{after}$\n- or expressed as $m_{1}u_{1} + m_{1}u_{2}=m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{1}$ \n\t- blah blah blah yk what each variable means.\n\t- if the objects colliding joins together then its $m_{1}u_{1}+m_{1}u_{2}=m_{3}v_{3}$\n\t- if the objects explode and break apart into two objects then it is $m_{1}u_{1}=m_{2}v_{2}+m_{3}v_{3}$\n### change in momentum // impulse\n- $i=\\Delta p=p_{final}-p_{initial}=mv-mu=m(v-u)$ (impulse is change in momentum)\n- area of force time graph = momentum change = impulse (since $F=\\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t}$)\n## energy\n### work\n- work is a measurement of how much energy to transfers forces\n- measured in joules ($\\frac{kg\\times m^2}{s^2}$), since work is = Fs = ma x s = m x m/s^2 x s\n\t- since W=Fs, 1J = 1N x 1m = 1Nm\n\t- 1J = 1N x 1m = 1kgm/s^2 x 1m = 1kgm^2/s^2\n### energy conservation\n### energy equations\n## power","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T05:46:50.676891128Z","tags":null},"/notes/archive/AEold/physics/testnotes/Sound-Properties":{"title":"Sound Properties","content":"\n## idk\n## loudness\nsubjective experience\n## intensity\n- objective measure of the rate at which the wave motion carries energy.\n- $P=\\frac{E}{t} \\implies I=\\frac{E\\div t}{A}\\implies I=\\frac{E}{At} \\implies I=\\frac{P}{A}$\n- a wave spreads out spherically from a point source. when the distance is doubled, the energy by the wave will spread out over four times the original area.\n- the behaviour is thus an inverse square law:\n\t- $I \\propto \\frac{1}{r^2}$\n\t- if the intensity is $I_{0}$ at a particular distance $r_{0}$, then $I_{0}=\\frac{1}{{r_{0}}^2}$\n\t\t- what?? \n\t- since the proportionality constants are the same, then the ratio of the intensities given as\n\t\t- $I_{0}{r_{0}}^2=I_{f}{r_{f}}^2$\n\t- $L(db)=10\\log \\frac{I}{I_{0}}$\n\t- **$\\frac{I_{f}}{I_{0}}=\\frac{{r_{0}}^2}{{r_{f}}^2}$ worth remembering!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-14T05:46:50.676891128Z","tags":null},"/notes/archive/AEold/physics/testnotes/Waves":{"title":"Waves","content":"\n## Tube Resonance\n(and the wavelength of sound)\n- what happens when you blow air on the top of a tube or cylinder\n\t- it will resonate\n- why does blowing the top of a bottle cause it to vibrate.\n\t- it causes turbulence\n- what is the top of the bottle called\n\t- when an air can move -

its something only studying can solve (ironic right)\n\ni want to talk about the listening aspect of japanese, and what i thin makes up the fundamentals of listening. much like how japanese itself is split into reading, writing, listening and speaking (and a 5th vocabulary), i think listening itself is split into:\n- macro\n\t- this is essentially how much you can comprehend what the reader is saying. \n\t- includes grammar points and basic vocabulary.\n\t- i would recognise this to be essential to be good at listening, if you can't comprehend what they're saying, then it is impossible to achieve a good listening mark.\n- micro\n\t- the ability to notice small nuances in the speaker, e.g. totemo, sukoshi, tai. picking up the small details is essential to achieve a top mark.\n- speed\n\t- how fast you can write down and translate what the speaker is saying.\n\t- this skill isn't that essential, but everyone needs to at some degree have a listening speed equal or greater than the reading speed of the speaker.\n\t- of course, this just takes practice.\n- memory\n\t- how long the information the speaker presents sticks in your brain.\n\nthats it, now ill work on my speaking.

life.\n\t\t- but the short-term goal-setting is something i struggle in identifiying and creating.\n\t\t- here is a list of short-term goals i can refer back to in the future:\n\t\t\t- test scores, already applicable and ineffective for me.\n\t\t\t- improving oneself to be better than yesterday.\n\t\t\t- competition.\n\t- time management: the aspect of managing time i can do easy enough, however, when it comes to following a schedule, i fail. i need to increase dicsipline in this area.\n\t- reflection: furthermore, i should reflect on tests and other areas to identitfy areas of improvement. i find myself not reflecting and rushing to the doing stage.\n- i hope i can refer back to todays daily taco to find a reason to derive my fundamental motivation from.\n\n🌮
