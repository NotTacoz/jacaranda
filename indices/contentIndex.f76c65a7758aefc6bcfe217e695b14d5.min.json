studying can solve (ironic right)\n\ni want to talk about the listening aspect of japanese, and what i thin makes up the fundamentals of listening. much like how japanese itself is split into reading, writing, listening and speaking (and a 5th vocabulary), i think listening itself is split into:\n- macro\n\t- this is essentially how much you can comprehend what the reader is saying. \n\t- includes grammar points and basic vocabulary.\n\t- i would recognise this to be essential to be good at listening, if you can't comprehend what they're saying, then it is impossible to achieve a good listening mark.\n- micro\n\t- the ability to notice small nuances in the speaker, e.g. totemo, sukoshi, tai. picking up the small details is essential to achieve a top mark.\n- speed\n\t- how fast you can write down and translate what the speaker is saying.\n\t- this skill isn't that essential, but everyone needs to at some degree have a listening speed equal or greater than the reading speed of the speaker.\n\t- of course, this just takes practice.\n- memory\n\t- how long the information the speaker presents sticks in your brain.\n\nthats it, now ill work on my speaking. surely that will have

the energy is transformed from one type of energy into another.\n\n[https://www.chemistrysteps.com/energy-and-organic-chemistry-reactions/](https://www.chemistrysteps.com/energy-and-organic-chemistry-reactions/)\n\n## Energy Consumption\n\n- The usage of energy in which energy is transformed and transferred to complete tasks\n    - Everyday examples of energy usage include watching television, washing clothes, heating and lighting the home.\n\n## Direct vs Indirect Energy Usage\n\n- Direct: Energy that is directly converted from one form to another to complete a task.\n    - Petrol in cars.\n    - Burning coal in coal plants generates electricity to power households.\n    - Gas-heated water.\n    \n- Indirect: Energy that requires multiple steps to complete a task.\n    - Consuming food for human energy needs that are heated up or cooked from fossil fuel energy.\n    - Burning fossil fuels (coal) generates electricity that powers television and other electronic devices, in which humans consumes as information via light and sound energy.\n    - Transportation of humans to save them potential energy by creating mechanical energy.\n    \n    ## What is Fossil Fuel?\n    \n    - Petroleum, coal and natural gas are natural fuels formed by the remains of living organism which is burned as fuel.\n    \n\n### Formation Process of Crude Oil (Fossil Fuels)\n\n‚Üí Microscopic ORGANIC plankton/phytoplankton in ocean photosynthesises \n\n‚Üí The organisms die and fall to the bottom of the ocean where they are covered by sediment \n\n‚Üí Layers of heavy sediment cause compaction (pressure) and are subjected to high

The vibrational energy is a form of kinetic energy, which produces heat.\n\n## The Greenhouse Effect Diagram\n\nClimate Definition: Long-term weather patterns\n\n### The Enhanced Greenhouse Effect\n\nMethane Gas\n\n‚Üí Traps Infrared Radiation\n\n‚Üí Heats Earth‚Äôs atmospheres ‚Üí Increase in average global temperatures ‚Üí Change in weather patterns\n\n‚Üí Altered ocean and wind currents\n\n‚Üí Extra ice melting\n\n‚Üí Extra sea level rising\n\n‚Üí Rapid Climate Change\n\nSuch as:\n\n- Higher bushfire rate and intensity.\n- Higher temperature.\n\n**TL:DR SUMMARY**: The Enhanced Greenhouse Effect is the process in which Methane Gas (most commonly sourced from cows, but could also be due to other factors) traps the infrared radiation produced from solar radiation, by blocking and absorbing the infrared radiation. This causes to heat the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, which increases the average global temperature. Climate Change describes Long-term weather pattern, and with increased average global temperatures, wind currents are altered, extra ice melts, and as a result of the ice melting, the sea level rises. This causes the long-term weather pattern to be disrupted and become chaotic, which results in undesirable natural disasters such as higher bushfire rate and intensity, as well as a higher temperature throughout the globe.\n\n# Organic Chemistry\n\n## What is Organic Chemistry?\n\n- Organic Chemistry is the study of Hydrocarbon compounds.\n\n## Fractional Distillation\n\n- Crude oil is an exceptionally valuable resource.\n    - Properties of a Black, Viscous, Thick and oozy liquid mixture.\n    - It is a mixture of many different hydrocarbons compounds.\n        - Hydrocarbon compounds contain different chain lengths.\n            - Intermolecular forces are forces ***between*** molecules\n                - The greater the number of molecules (hence having a longer chain), the greater the intermolecular force.\n                - Hydrocarbons with shorter chains have weaker intermolecular force.\n                - Less energy is to break/pull the shorter chained hydrocarbons. Vice versa.\n                    - The process of breaking is evaporation of the chains, by turning it from liquid to gas.\n                    - Heat energy is used to break apart the hydrocarbons.\n                    - A higher temperature is required to break apart longer chained hydrocarbons.\n            - Intramolecular forces are forces ***in*** molecules\n- Fractional Distillation is a separation process based on differing boiling points of different fractions.\n    - Fraction: A group of crude oil constituents that has a similar boiling point.\n    - $\\therefore$\n- Through this, it provides Hydrocarbons, which is used to manufacture many different chemicals and even plastics.\n\n## Fractional Distillation in Steps\n\n1. In a furnace, the crude oil is heated up to a very high temperature.\n2. The hot oil, now mostly in vapour form is pumped into the **fractionating column**.\n    1. The fractionating column has a heat gradient.\n        1. Hot at the bottom, Cool at the top.\n3. Hydrocarbons rise through the **fractionating column** (as gas) making their way through bubble caps in each tray.\n4. Depending on the boiling point, hydrocarbons will get to a same level in the **fractioning column, condense**, and be collected in a **fractionating tray** outside the column.\n    1. The fractionating tray is a tray of hydrocarbons that has condensed at the same temperature\n    2. Same boiling point hydrocarbons will have the same temperature where their chains are converted from liquid to gas.\n5. Hydrocarbons with similar boiling point are collected in the same try and become one fraction.\n\nTL:DR; Crude oil is a mixture of important hydrocarbons, and fractional distillation is the method used to separate the hydrocarbons in crude oil. Hydrocarbons move up the **fractionating column**, until each fraction turns into their respective liquid.\n\n## Usage of different hydrocarbon fractions\n\n- Petrol\n    - Fuel for cars.\n- Naptha\n    - Essential ingredient for plastic, and other plastics.\n- Kerosine\n    - Aircraft fuel.\n- Diesel\n    - Cars or vans.\n- Bitumen\n    - A mixture of large chained hydrocarbons used to lay road.\n- Butane\n    - The gas that comes out of gas taps in the school classrooms.\n\n## Alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, cycloalkanes, cycloalkenes\n\n+functional groups and generale formula :)\n\n\u003caside\u003e\nüóíÔ∏è Naming doesn‚Äôt yet account for isomers (covered in another section)\n\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\n### Alkyl\n\nMethyl $CH_3$\n\nEthyl $C_2H_3$\n\nPropyl $C_3H_7$\n\n- Question: Compare saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons\n- Answer: Each carbon atom bonds with the maximum number of hydrogen atoms in a saturated Hydrocarbon.\n    - Compared to, an unsaturated hydrocarbon, where less than the maximum amount of hydrogen is bonded to carbons.\n        \n        Saturated hydrocarbons are relatively unreactive.

Elements are composed of extremely small, indivisible particles called atoms.\n\t2. All Atoms of given element are identical having same size, mass and chemical properties. Atoms of different elements have different size, mass and chemical properties.\n\t3. Atoms are not created or destroyed during chemical reaction.\n\t4. A chemical reaction involves only separation, combination. Or rearrangement of atoms.\n\t5. Compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine in a specific ratio.\n- Many of the atomic theory is wrong and disproven by modern atomic theory (1, 2, 5), but his original proposition granted a new perspective on atoms.\n- ### three laws (DO WE EVEN NEED TO KNOW THIS)\n\t- #### The law of definite proportions:\n\t\t- mr dalton proposed \"compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine in a specific ratio\" \n\t\t- this is true given our modern understanding of chemistry.\n\t\t- e.g. calcium oxide will only occur with ca and o in fixed ratios\n\t- #### The law of conservation of mass\n\t\t- mr dalton proposed \"atoms are not created nor destroyed or changed into different types; a chemical reaction involves separation, combination or rearrangement of atoms.\" thus there must be the same amount of atoms in the reactants of a chemical reaction as the atoms in the product.\n\t- #### The law of multiple proportions\n\t\t- mr dalton proposed \"whenever two elements form more than one compound, the different masses of one element that combines with a fixed mass of the \" WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG THIS IS LIMITED AND DISPROVEN THROUGH POLYMERS (?) AND OLIGOMERS (?)\n- ## disadvantages of his theory:\n\t1. Atoms are divisible, they are made of smaller particles known as subatomic particles.\n\t2. Not all atoms for a given element are identical: some elements have atoms that differ in terms of \u003cu\u003emass\u003c/u\u003e and \u003cu\u003edensity\u003c/u\u003e (different number of neutrons). These are called isotopes.\n\t3. Elements are not in fact different in all aspects, eg argon calcium both have AMU of 40 (isobars)\n\t4. dalton claims elements combine in whole number ratio, which isn't true in complex compounds\n\t5. allotropes contradict the statement elements of the same kind have same properties. e.g. charcoal, graphite, diamond.\n\t6. no suggestion to the structure of the atom\n# JJ Thomson 1897-1904\n- Discovered the electron.\n- cathode ray experiment\n\t- in a sealed (evaporated) glass tube, metal terminals are placed at each end, acting as electrodes.\n\t- invisible rays called cathode rays are produced from a cathode (negative terminal) towards the anode, which causes certain materials (called phosphors, such as neon) to glow.\n\t- Thomson observed and concluded that cathode rays was a stream of negatively charged particles with mass, which became known as electrons.\n\t\t- Passed through electric and magnetic fields:\n\t\t\t- cathode rays passed straight through\n\t\t\t\t- thus cathode rays are affected by electric and magnetic fields.\n\t\t\t- the field deviates towards the positive plate. \n\t\t\t\t- thus the ray is negatively charged\n\t\t\t- diagram: ![](content/notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020230301090847.png)\n- He determined the mass of the particle to be ~1/2000 AMU since the magnitude of the fields is known.\n- he realised that\n\t- atoms contain negatively charged particles.\n\t\t- he repeated the experiment with multiple types of materials in the cathode, but the beam is produced every time.\n\t- since all atoms are neutral:\n\t- atoms also must contain a positively charged particles.\n- ## plum pudding model\n\t- he knew atoms were neutral and contained negative charge.\n\t\t- therefore they must contain equal positive charge.\n\t- thomson suggested atom is comprised of electrons and protons spread with uniform mass and charge.\n\t- weaknesses\n\t\t- electrons is now known to be occupying fixed orbitals\n\t\t- under the model, alpha particles would not be deflected against an element, and passes right through, which does not align with the results found in the gold leaf experiment.\n\n# Ernest Rutherford 1911\n- alpha particles shoot at gold leaf (a thin sheet of gold a few atoms wide)\n- sheet is surrounded by zinc sulfide\n\t- alpha particles collide with zinc sulfide to make flashes of light and microscope is used to observe the impact position.\n- observations:\n\t1. most alpha particles pass through gold foil\n\t\t- this means that most of an element is empty space\n\t2. some alpha particles were deflected (in a minor way)\n\t\t- the discovery of a neutral, the nucleus region in the atom.\n\t\t- there must exist a positively charged region called a proton.\n\t\t- this also means that the positively charged region is a small part of the atom.\n\t3. some alpha particles were deflected (significantly)\n\t\t- reconfirms that protons must be concentrated at the centre of the atom (nucleus)\n\t- expectations of the atom was that\n\t\t- the alpha particles pass through the atom or none passes through, but instead some were deflected.\n- ### rutherfords model\n\t- atom comprises of mostly empty space. the space is occupied by electrons.\n\t- electron orbits a small central region (0.05%)\n# Niels Bohr 1913\n- Orbitals of electrons, and the line emission spectra.\n- Scientists found that when an electric discharge is passed throguh a discharge tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, it emits light.\n- The light when passed through a prism split sup into a set of 5 lines. This spectrum is called the line spectrum of hydrogen. This is known as the \u003cu\u003eline emission spectrum\u003c/u\u003e. Scientists were unable to explain this.\n- ## bohr's model\n- bohr's model stated the following: (the three postulates)\n\t- **fixed orbital**: electrons move in a circular orbit around the nucleus under influence of electrostatic attraction of the nucleus.\n\t- **angular momentum is quantised**\n\t\t- electrons occupy fixed energy levels\n\t\t- these fixed energy levels do not emit radiation, as these orbits are stable (see [Maxwell's Law](notes/AE/chemistry/lessonnotes/MAXWELLS-LAW.md))\n\t- **energy transitions**: electrons can transition to higher or lower energy levels by emitting or absorbing fixed quantities of energy (photons)\n\t\t- an electron can transition to a higher state by absorbing a photo with energy equal to the exact difference in energies between 2 electron orbits (final and initial)\n\t\t- an electron can transition to a lower state by emitting a photo with energy equal to the exact difference in energies between 2 electron orbits (final and initial)\n- ### emission spectra\n\t- when an electric discharge is passed through a discharge tube, electrons that are found in the discharge transfer some kinetic energy during collision to the atoms' electrons.\n\t- the electron issued the atom is then excited to a higher energy state, and the incident electron will decelerate and be deflected in another direction (?)\n\t- electrons become unstable in higher energy state, and will transition down to the ground state. \n\t\t- this releases energy in the form of radiation, the energy is equal to E2-E1.\n\t- frequency of the radiation (therefore colour) is proportional to the energy it has, one specific wavelength/frequency of light will be produced per transition.\n\t- a unique set of photons with a specific wavelength is produced (as multiple transitions can occur within an atom). when these emissions are captured and analysed in a line spectrometer, you can only see one light present.\n- unique spectra: discrete energy levels for atoms are fixed and unique/atom.\n\t- as a result the discrete energy level differences are also fixed and unique to each element.\n\t- each element has difference emission and absorption spectra as the range frequencies of light emitted are based on the discrete energy level differences.\n\t- electrons are quantised (only specific/discrete values are allowed), as in they cannot be between electron energy shells.\n\t\t- the electrons are bumped up/down by absorbing or emitting photon energy.\n- ### problems with bohrs model\n\t- multi-electron atoms\n\t\t- does not work with atoms with 1+ electrons in the valence shell, as it's not possible to calculate all the spectral lines of all other atoms, as this model has classical components (electrostatic attraction)\n\t- relative intensities of spectral lines\n\t\t- the spectral lines are not of equal density\n\t\t- bohrs model doesn't explain why some electron transition would be favoured, and wavelength of light appears more intense in the spectra.\n\t- hyperfine lines\n\t\t- 2 bands contained in a single band\n\t- zeeman effect\n\t\t- when a gas is excited in a magnetic field, emission spectrum shows a splitting of the spectral lines.\n\n# James Chadwick 1932\n- discovered the neutron\n- determined protons made only 1/2 the mass of the atom when he analysed Rutherford's experimental data; specifically the extent and frequency of alpha particle defllection.\n- Thus he believed there was a hidden component of the atom that constituted its remaining mass (50%)\n- ## Experiment\n- in 1932, he discovered that beryllium when bombarded with alpha particles emitted a very energetic stream of radiation, originally thought to be gamma.\n- the properties did not align with gamma rays. it was penetrating alike gamma rays, and it was not deflected upon passing through a magnetic field, therefore it was neutral.\n- radiation when collided with paraffin\n\n# Development of atomic structure\n\nAtomic theory, ancient greeks thought everything was made of a solid matter which cannot be broken down even more\n\nJohn dalton proposed atoms as solid spheres, and there exists different types of spheres for different elements.\n\nJJ Thompson plum pudding model - showed that there exists electrons (negatively charged particles) inside the atom\n\nErnest Rutherford nuclear model, discovered the nucleus, and assumed negative charge surrounds it through the gold leaf experiment, some alpha particles were deflected. Flaw was electron rush into nucleus causing it to collapse\n\nNiels Bohr proposed electron orbit and energy levels of electrons.\n\nGround state blah blah blah\n\n# tl:dr\nlazy fuck\n1. john dalton 1803\n\t1. atomic theory of matter\n\t2. said a lot of wrong shit, but was fundamental to modern atomic theory\n\t3. said\n\t\t1. everything is made up of undivisible particles called atoms\n\t\t2. atoms of different elements have different physical/chemical properties\n\t\t3. atoms of the same elements has the same physical/chemical properties e.g. size n stuff\n\t\t4. atoms cannot be created or destroyed\n\t\t\t1. therefore in a equation the reactants must equal the products\n\t\t5. A chemical reaction involves only separation, combination. Or rearrangement of atoms.\n\t\t6. there exists compounds, which is atoms but in a specific ratio.\n2. jj thomson 1904\n\t1. discovered electrons\n\t2. cathode ray tube experiment\n\t\t1. partially evacuated tube\n\t\t2. cathode and anode on each side\n\t\t3. the tube produces cathode rays (electrons)\n\t\t4. jj thomson discovered that positive magnetic and electric forces deviated the cathode ray towards it. (deflects towards the positive plate)\n\t\t\t1. this is because negative particles are attracted to positive plate.\n\t\t5. jj thomson observed this and concluded that negatively charged. particles must exist in an atom (a positively charged \"soup\")\n\t\t6. the experiment was done with cathodes made of multiple materials.\n3. ernest rutherford 1911\n\t1. discovered nucleus\n\t2. gold leaf experiment\n\t\t1. bombarded thin gold leaf (gold because it is malleable) with hella alpha particles (because alpha particles are positively charged)\n\t\t2. the gold leaf is surrounded by zinc sulfide screen (cos the screen glows when alpha particles strike it)\n\t\t3. the alpha particles mostly passed through the leaf, but some were deflected (minorly and majorly)\n\t\t4. this led rutherford to conclude there is a concentrated area of the atom where the mass is.\n4. niels bohr 1913\n\t1. bohr modified rutherfords model\n\t2. he stated electrons moved around the nucleus in orbits.\n\t3. and electron energy is quantised (electrons are found in discrete energy levels)\n\t4. electrons could not occupy transitional states (between energy levels)\n5. james chadwick 1932\n\t1. discovered the neutron\n\t2. polonium source produced alpha particles bombarding beryllium, which produced an intense radiation.\n\t3. the particles were about the same mass as the proton.\n\n![](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020230301185219.png)\n\nrelated: \n- [emission spectra](notes/AE/chemistry/lessonnotes/EMISSION-SPECTRA.md)\n- [flame test](notes/AE/chemistry/lessonnotes/FLAME-TEST.md)\n- [cap checklist](notes/AE/chemistry/lessonnotes/CAP1CHECKLIST.md)","lastmodified":"2023-03-24T02:01:45.38433229Z","tags":null},"/notes/AE/chemistry/lessonnotes/CAP1CHECKLIST":{"title":"cap 1 checklist","content":"\nlil checklist to make sure ive studied everything :)\n\n# task 1: line spectra\nThis 25 mark task will assess your understanding of the concepts related to Experiment 8 (Flame Tests) and Experiment 9 (Emission Spectra). \nAs it is a Science Inquiry Skills task, there will be questions related to the experimental aspects of the experiments. \nIt will also be important to understand the underlying chemistry concepts, particularly atomic absorption and emission spectra.\n- [x] revise science inquiry skills\n- [ ] how does the experiments impact accuracy and reliability\n- [ ] atomic absorption\n- [ ] emission spectra\n# task 6\n- [x] John Dalton\n- [x] J.J.

Sample of the element/compound is introduced to a colourless, non-luminous flame.\n\t- In the experiment, we used ethanol, which was a coloured flame rather than a colourless one. This reduced the accuracy of the experiment and is therefore a systematic error.\n2. As substance is heated, electrons become excited, as they gain energy the electrons can transition into a higher energy state.\n3. Because the electrons are in a higher energy state, they are unstable. So they quickly transition back to their ground state, which emits photons with specific wavelengths (equal to the diff in energy levels)\n4. Therefore, the photons have specific wavelengths, and the specific wavelengths mean specific colours are observed.\n5. Since excited electrons can transition to their ground state in multiple stages, a set of diff photons of diff wavelengths can be emitted.\n\t- This means a spectra of different wavelengths of light is noticed.\n6. This test is only valid for some metals, as most non-metals emit frequencies outside of visible spectrum, and cannot be identified.\n## What can the test be used for\n- Ionic salts: simple ionic solids and metals can be used.\n- Because when heated, the metal ions and anions separate, producing emission within visible spectrum.\n## weaknesses of flame test\n-  the test cannot detect low concentrations of most¬†[ions](notes/AE/chemistry/lessonnotes/DEFINITIONS.md).\n- salt metal may not be excited by relatively low temperature of the ethanoal flame (magnesium)\n- salt may not be completely excited (diff colour being observed)\n- does not work with most non metals\n- ethanol and oxygen may get involved, changing the observed colour.\n- The brightness of the signal varies from one sample to another. For example, the yellow emission from sodium is much brighter than the red emission from the same amount of¬†lithium.\n- Impurities or contaminants affect the test results.¬†[Sodium](https://www.thoughtco.com/sodium-element-facts-606471), in particular, is present in most compounds and will colour the flame. Sometimes a blue glass is used to filter out the yellow of sodium.\n- The test cannot differentiate between all elements. Several metals produce the same flame colour.

'Where the Crawdads Sing' is an American mystery and detective fiction film directed by Olivia Newman from a screenplay by Lucy Alibar based on the book written by Delia Owens of the same name. The film explores themes of isolation and violence. The story follows Kya, a girl who spends most of her life alone in the marsh due to rejection by society, who winds up being the primary suspect of a murder case. Kya's \"righteous\" motive draws similarities to Owens' personal experiences, in which the death of multiple animal poachers is allegedly the fault of Owens. Through the understanding of the film and its context I as the contemporary reader develop an empathetic but critical response to the actions of the murderer.\n\n# Body Paragraph 1\n- characterisation: the characterisation of Kya, a nature loving independent and isolated girl who will do anything to achieve her goals, including murder, parallels Delia Owens, a nature loving conservationist who would protect against poachers at any cost.\n- both characters are strong female heroines.\n- this developed my response of appreciation of their resolve to protect their peace and isolation at any cost, but im critical towards the fact they value the upkeep of nature to a human life, and their view that you can only have one, but not the other.\n# Body Paragraph 2\n- environment: the large marsh which sees more animals than humans is parallel to the environment of zambia which mark and delia owens lived.\n- like how delia adored africa, kya adored the marsh, both appreciating the solitude and isolation it provides, as well how the nature in it functions.\n- this constructs my response to understand that the environment can change the direction of a moral compass. people raised in normal society, who interacts with other humans values lives over anything else, but the marsh and african environment, in which perpetual life cycles of living and dying could be found anywhere and everywhere allows me to understand why kya and delia owens appreciate the company of animals, and do not put a higher value on human lives as others do.\n# Body Paragraph 3\n- values of murder: kya and delia owens, under the impact of environment and characterisation, both view murder as a \"way of life\".\n- kya doesn't hesitate in murdering chase andrews, and manages to elaborately set up a plan and execute it to perfection, whilst delia owens allows and actively trains game scouts to take down and capture poachers with her husband and son mark and christopher owens.","lastmodified":"2023-03-24T02:01:45.38433229Z","tags":null},"/notes/AE/english/WTCS-PRAC2":{"title":"WTCS-PRAC2","content":"\n1.¬†¬†¬†¬† Discuss how your attitudes influence your response to the way a controversy is represented in at least one text.\n\nResponses are affected by the reader‚Äôs attitudes and how the text conveys certain ideas, such as if the text establishes context. This is underlined in the film ‚ÄúWhere the Crawdads Sing‚Äù (2022) directed by Olivia Newman from screenplay by Lucy Alibar adapted from the novel of the same name. The film follows a coming-of-age story of an isolated girl named Kya, who is raised in the marsh and is suspected of the murder of a man she was once romantically involved with. My attitudes as the contemporary audience towards ideas of discrimination, isolation and relationships influence my response and positions me to be empathetic towards Kya in the representation of a murder case as the controversy.\n\nAs the contemporary attitude, my critical attitude towards discrimination influences my response to be condemning towards the accusation and the townspeople, believing they are motivated by prejudice and bias common in 1950s America rather than justice. The prejudice against Kya is highlighted with the townspeople always referring to Kya as ‚Äúthe marsh girl.‚Äù This label marks Kya as nothing other than her origins, something she cannot change. The label placed on Kya is similar to slurs against people based on their origin that is now shunned in contemporary society. The societal criticism of discrimination is much more different than 1950s America, where there are less consequences and seen as less serious. This labelling of Kya based on her origins, something she cannot change, influences my response to be empathetic towards Kya when she is accused of murder. [evidence 2, elaboration 2 goes here]. [link goes here]\n\nMy response to the representation of the controversy of the murder is influenced by my solemn (?) attitude towards isolation. Kya, ever since a young age has experienced isolation, not at her own fault, but the situation she was born in led eventually to her entire family one after the other abandoning the marsh, and consequentially, Kya (too long how to shorten). Kya reflects on this by stating that she ‚Äúhad a family once‚Äù who ‚Äúcalled [her] Kya.‚Äù The use of past tense in ‚Äúonce‚Äù and ‚Äúcalled‚Äù shows that Kya no longer has a family, nor does she have someone who calls by her real name, highlighting her loss of identity as Kya, and is now seen more as a ‚Äúmarsh girl‚Äù (should‚Äôve used this for BP1 lmao). This is significant in influencing my response, as when she was revealed to be the murderer, my attitudes towards isolation influences my response to be empathetic, as the isolation she experienced and her exposure to the nature may present Kya a different viewpoint on life and death than everybody else, seeing it as an eventual constant rather than something to grieve over. [link and more bps here]\n\nFurthermore, my response to the murder case is influenced by my attitude towards relationships, in which I believe personal connection is an essential need contemporary context, in which social media and the growing connection with the technological word has led to a time where society is embedded more in social connection than any other time period of history. This is evidenced when Kya begged Tate to ‚Äúplease stay‚Äù, as she does not want to experience isolation again. In the contemporary context, where social media and every day the world gets more connected online, my attitude on social connection is that it is a basic human necessity and something everyone wishes to attain. This attitude further develops my empathy towards Kya in the trial, as she did not have the human connections relative to everybody else to learn what is socially acceptable and rather her environment of the marsh has shaped her character and perspective on life. When Tate doesn‚Äôt come back when he promised, Kya came to the realisation that ‚Äúpeople don‚Äôt stay‚Äù, and she ‚Äúhad to do life alone‚Äù this shows although Kya wishes for social connection, those who are close to her consistently abandoned her eventually, to a point she feels she naturally undeserving of companionship (quote should go here). My attitude on the necessity of social connection furthers my empathetic response towards Kya. Hence, through my contemporary attitude on the necessity of social connection my response is empathetic towards Kya‚Äôs situation, because people she had connections with eventually abandoned her. (maybe unneeded last part)\n\nAs a contemporary reader, my attitudes on discrimination, isolation and social connection influences my response to be overall empathetic towards Kya. My critical attitude on discrimination, solemn attitude towards isolation, and the attitude on social connection, viewing it as a basic necessity everyone wishes to attain, all influences my response to be empathetic towards Kya. The portrayal of Kya as innocent and empathised towards the contemporary audience is significant in establishing that contextual information and backstory may change the perception and response by readers.\n\nGeneral observations\n\n-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Very very weak evidence, not enough ratio in terms of evidence to analysis. (what is the correct evidence analysis ratio?)\n\n-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Elaboration too complex and repetitive maybe.\n\n-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Needs link\n\n-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Expand body paragraphs 1,2\n\n-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Topic ideas are less overarching and seemingly develops as the essay develops rather than an umbrella concept (idk if this makes sense)\n\n-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Empathetic response is overused (used for all of them), maybe think of something else.\n\n-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Identifying main points in conclusion seems kind of weak\n\n-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Weak pointing of significance of tet\n\nExplain how at least one text conforms to generic conventions while still challenging its audience.\n\nFollowing conventions of genres is important, but to be distinct and create a piece of media that offers a new perspective, texts should subvert areas of genre to bring on new ideas. The 2022 film ‚ÄúWhere the Crawdads Sing‚Äù directed by Olivia Newman from screenplay by Lucy Alibar based on 2018 novel of the same name my Delia Owens challenges and subverts the detective fiction genre and ideas surrounding it. The film follows the coming-of-age story of a girl raised in the marsh called Kya, who is suspected to be the murderer of someone who she was once romantically involved with. The text although conforming to certain ideas of the detective fiction genre, such as creating characters common within a detective fiction and following a common structure of a detective fiction, as more information is revealed to the audience as the story progresses, subverts and challenges the protagonist not being actively involved in solving the murder, and rejecting the traditional detective fiction ending to challenge or surprised the audience.\n\n‚ÄúWhere the Crawdads Sing‚Äù conforms to the detective fiction genre through generic conventions of characterisation but subverts and challenges the audience by making the protagonist not involved with solving the murder, but the suspect. The victim of the story is Chase Andrews, and the film conforms to the detective fiction genre by describing the details and specificity of his death, whilst also providing information on Chase Andrews, such as describing him as ‚Äúthe star quarterback of town‚Äù through an alternative timeline of the past which the film switches between. The characterisation of the victim and providing details similar to other detective fiction allows the contemporary audience a chance to figure out the mystery using provided clues to race against detectives and police officers in the novel. However, the text challenges the detective fiction genre by characterising Kya as not a prodigy or wise detective, but a young girl who is suspected of the crime. This challenges the traditional detective fiction approach, in which the protagonist is often a young prodigy or old experienced eccentric detective. This challenges the audience expectations, as although giving a greater insight to what happened, the recollections of the past may be from an unreliable narrator, which subverts from the standard of how detective cases are presented for the audience to solve, in which detectives can make more unbiased judgements. Thus, through the text‚Äôs utilisation of characterisation, ‚ÄúWhere the Crawdads Sing‚Äù conforms to the detective fiction‚Äôs characterisation of the victim by developing his backstory and details of death but subverts and challenges the contemporary audience by making the protagonist the suspect rather than the detective.\n\nFurthermore, the text utilises narrative conventions of plot to conform to the detective fiction genre through following a linear storyline in relation to time and reveals more information and clues as the story progresses, but challenges audiences and expectations by rejecting the traditional ending within detective fiction to surprise the audience. The film switches back and forth between two-time periods of before the murder occurred, from when Kya was a child, and the aftermath, in which Kya was held at trial. The film uses the past to provide contextual information and clues on the murder, whilst the trial shows the ongoing decision that the jury will come to. This format allows the audience to intake information as film progress and allow them to make an educated decision on what the cause of the death of Chase Andrews was, which conforms to the detective fiction genre which slowly displaces clues and information about the case before the detective comes to a final conclusion, finding the murderer, or in this case determining if the suspect is guilty or not. However, the text subverts expectations by not revealing the actual murder, but instead hints in the ending that Kya was the one who did it, with her leaving a letter of confession right before passing away. This is different from traditional detective fiction endings, in which justice is served to the criminal, and everyone gets a happy ending. This challenges the audience to feel outraged at the fact that the murderer wasn‚Äôt condemned, unlike other detective fiction tales. Hence, through the employment of narrative conventions of plot, the detective fiction generic convention of slowly revealing clues as the story progresses is conformed, but challenges the audience when Kya was revealed to be the murderer, and the audience discovers that justice was not served.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Where the Crawdads Sing\" directed by Olivia Newman from screenplay by Lucy Alibar based on 2018 novel of the same name by Delia Owens subverts and challenges the traditional ideas surrounding the detective fiction genre. While conforming to certain conventions of the genre, the film challenges the protagonist's passive role in solving the murder and rejects the typical detective fiction ending to surprise and challenge the audience. By doing so, the film offers a unique perspective on justice and the criminal justice system. This text ultimately highlights the importance of challenging and subverting traditional ideas and genres to offer new and unique perspectives on familiar concepts.\n\nideas\n\n-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Human connection \u0026 independence\n\no¬†¬† ‚Äúplease stay‚Äù\n\n¬ß¬† Kya begs of Tate to ‚Äúplease stay‚Äù, highlighting her inner yearning for human connection and companionship. The desire for emotional support and closeness is further emphasised by the desperation in her voice and the vulnerability in her body language.\n\no¬†¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if anyone really knows me‚Äù.\n\n¬ß¬† Kya states that she doesn‚Äôt know ‚Äúif anybody really knows [her]‚Äù. This expresses her isolation and feeling disconnected with everything around her and reveals Kya‚Äôs doubts on if there is anybody out there who understands her.\n\no¬†¬† ‚ÄúI had to do life alone‚Ä¶ people don‚Äôt stay‚Äù.\n\n¬ß¬† Kya reflects on her experience of abandonment by stating that she ‚Äúhad to do life alone‚Äù, and people in her life ‚Äúdon‚Äôt stay‚Äù. This statement highlights Kya‚Äôs loneliness and her struggles to form lasting connections with others. Her innate realisation people don‚Äôt stay suggest a sense of despair, and that all her life she never had the chance to experience a lasting human connection.\n\n-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Prejudice\n\no¬†¬† ‚ÄúThey call you the marsh girl‚Ä¶where you been, marsh hen?... where‚Äôs your hat swamp rat?‚Äù\n\n¬ß¬† Marsh girl, marsh hen, swamp rat\n\n¬ß¬† Throughout the story, Kya is subjected to ridicule and ostracism because of her isolation and poverty, as evidenced when the townspeople use derogatory names such as ‚Äúmarsh girl‚Äù, ‚Äúmarsh hen‚Äù, and ‚Äúswamp rat.‚Äù These epithets reduce Kya‚Äôs identity to a mere label and reinforces the idea that she is inferior to others, and does not deserve formal education, respect or dignity.\n\no¬†¬† ‚ÄúI never hated them, they hated me.‚Äù\n\n¬ß¬† Kya stating that she ‚Äúnever hated them‚Äù, but ‚Äúthey hated‚Äù her highlights that although she was ostracised and judged by the people of her community because of her isolation and poverty, she never harboured any hate towards them, but is instead the victim of prejudice, underscoring the ways discrimination can harm those who did nothing wrong.\n\no¬†¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not deciding anything about me. It‚Äôs them. They are judging themselves.‚Äù\n\n¬ß¬† Kya reflects on the ostracization she received and determined that the prejudice against her isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdeciding anything about‚Äù her, but instead the townspeople are ‚Äújudging themselves.‚Äù She recognises that that townspeople judgement and prejudice are saying more about themselves than they are about her. This characterisation shows Kya‚Äôs developed self-acceptance, in which Kya is able to find resilience in the face of adversity.\n\n-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Nature // The marsh\n\no¬†¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like having a friend your whole life but you never see their face‚Äù.\n\n¬ß¬† Kya's statement, \"It's like having a friend your whole life but you never see their face\" highlights the power of nature and the deep connection that individuals can feel with their surroundings. Kya has grown up in the marsh, where she has developed a profound bond with the natural world around her. Her statement suggests that this connection is as deep and meaningful as a friendship, despite the fact that it does not involve human interaction.\n\no¬†¬† ‚Äúthe only constant in nature is change‚Äù\n\n¬ß¬† In Where the Crawdads Sing, the statement \"the only constant in nature is change\" reflects the idea that everything in the natural world is subject to transformation and evolution. This statement is particularly significant for Kya, who has grown up in the marsh and has developed a deep understanding of the natural world around her. Her experiences have taught her that the environment is constantly shifting and adapting, and that individuals must be willing to accept and adapt to these changes.\n\no¬†¬† ‚Äúthe marsh knows all about death.‚Äù\n\n¬ß¬† In Where the Crawdads Sing, the statement \"the marsh knows all about death\" reflects the idea that nature is intimately connected with the cycle of life and death. Kya has grown up in the marsh, and is disconnected from her community, so she has developed a deep understanding of the natural world around her. Her experiences have taught her that death is a natural and necessary part of life, and that the marsh is both a site of birth and of decay.\n\nExplore how at least one text reveals that the values and attitudes of an individual or group are shaped by their circumstances.\n\nStylistic choices -\u003e genre\n\nLanguage features -\u003e film conventions","lastmodified":"2023-03-24T02:01:45.38433229Z","tags":null},"/notes/AE/english/WTCS-THE-OTHER":{"title":"WTCS-THE-OTHER","content":"\n# the concept of the other\n- broad term that refers to individuals or groups who are been seen on the margins.\n- outside of mainstream or what is considered normal\n- the other is usually represented as different, but as inferior, less powerful and worthy.\n- kya for example is represented as someone who the townspeople think doesn't deserve compassion, education or a family.\n# relation to values and attitudes and ideologies.\n- for example in western society, we value and respect others, need a job to work hard and make money, and value ideas about family and education.\n# binary oppositions\n- sense of self and other are binary oppositions.\n- the self and the other are social constructs that involve a power difference. \n# politics\n- rapid changes in technology and social demographics through migration and globalisation has redefined dominant culture and what it means to be a member of mainstream media.\n# how to construct others\n- others are often people who are romanticised, feared, stereotyped or pitied - someone who is different.\n- kya is WTCS is feared, pitied, excluded and scorned.\n# gender\n- the idea of an independent female, rare in the  1960s leads to kya being see as an other, as she is different from other women of the same time period.\n# outsiders\n- outsider is a popular character type who is earned by those who exist outside the norm of dominant spheres of identity.","lastmodified":"2023-03-24T02:01:45.38433229Z","tags":null},"/notes/AE/english/WTCS-VALUES-ATTITUDES":{"title":"WTCS-VALUES-ATTITUDES","content":"# values and attitudes\n- values and attitudes are embedded in texts (visual, written and multimodal texts)\n- values are what individuals or groups think are important and hold to be worth (e.g. justice, honesty, education)\n- dominant values are those values that are widely shared among a group, community, or culture in a particular context.\n- attitudes¬†are the positions held or responses an individual or group make, as a result of their values.

two quantities vary proportionately if one is **always** a **constant multiple** of the other.\n- something something more goes here \n\n## inverse proportion\n- two quantities are **inversely** proportionate if one is always a constant multiple of **the inverse** of the other.\n\t- e.g. if you travel 72km at a constant speed, then your travel time (t hours) is inversely proportional to your speed ($v$ km/h), since t is always 72 times the inverse of $v$ (i.e. $t=\\frac{72}{v}$\n\t- \"y is proportional to $\\frac{1}{x}$\" can be written as: $$y\\propto \\frac{1}{x}$$\n\t- this can then be written as an equation as follows: $$y=\\frac{k}{x}$$\n\t- where k is the **constant of proportionality**.\n- From the equation, you can observe the following:\n\t- as x increases, y decreases (if k is positive), but not at a constant rate (i.e. not a straight line)\n\t- the constant of proportionality can be found as follows: $$k=xy$$\n\t- this can also be used as a test - if xy is constant for

respect to the origin.\n- position is a vector quantity, therefore it requires a direction.\n- ### distance travelled\n- distance describes how far an object travels during a journey.\n- if sophie completes three lengths of a 50m pool, the distance would be 50 + 50 + 50 = 150m\n- distance is not affected by the direction, and is a variable that always increases as the object moves.\n\t- therefore it is a scalar quantity\n- ### displacement\n- change in position of an object.\n- takes into account only where the motion starts and finishes, so the journey in between isnt taken into account when calculating displacement.\n\u003e vector quantity\n\u003e displacement s = final position - initial position\n- if somebody runs 100m and 100m back, displacement would still be 0 m, because the distance from the origin hasn't changed.\n- you can also calculate total displacement by summing up the individual displacements\n- e.g. a car is displaced 50m right from the origin, and then displaced -50m right\n- s = 50 + (-50) = 0m\n## speed and velocity\n- gives indication of how fast the position of an objection is changing\n- speed is magnitude, velocity is a vector.\n- ###

make sure for one direction arrows (and 2 direction) say like the direction of the arrows too.\n\t- ##### vectors in two directions\n\t\t- horizontal plane (north east south west)\n\t\t\t- you can use true bearing or you can use quadrant bearing\n\t\t\t- iirc quadrant bearing is recommended for physics\n\t\t\t- basically N/SdegreesE/W\n\t\t\t\t- pretty self explanatory stuff\n\t\t\t\t- in words you write like from north x degrees towards the east or whatever direction lmao\n\t\t- vertical plane (up down left right)\n\t\t\t- ![](notes/images/Screen%20Shot%202023-03-22%20at%206.09.31%20pm.png) i dont really want to describe and say all this shit but u get the idea\n\t- yeah thats basically it do the review chapter !!!\n#### vector addition\n- [ ] how to add and subtracts vectors in two dimensions\n- sometimes more than one vector can act upon an object (no way wtf?!?!?!)\n\t- so you need to add vectors\n\t- and find resultant of the two vectors.\n- vectors 3d also exists but not tested ofc\n- same dimension vectors are collinear (parallel)\n\t- so just simplify to + and - and add them together normally\n- graphical method\n\t- use head to tail method\n\t- join up the tail of 1 vector to the head of another.\n- ##### two dimensions \n- head to tail method and parallelogram (not going to be bothered with parallelogram cos basically same method for same results)\n- for head to tail like add the head and tail together.\n\t- get the angle of the shit and use trig (cosine and sine rule)\n\t- and calculate the hypotenuse of the angles.\n\t- draw it geometrically if you need help wit it\n- subtracting vectors you just get the opposite vector\n\t- e.g. -30metres west is just 30metres east.\n### applications of suvat, and the equations\nplease refer to my useful notes on [displacement, speed and velocity](notes/AE/physics/pearson/7.1.md) and [acceleration](notes/AE/physics/pearson/7.2.md) \n- equations you should know applications for:\n$$V_{avg}=\\frac{s}{t},a=\\frac{v-u}{t},v=u+at,s+ut+\\frac{1}{2}at^2,v^2=u^2+2as$$\n(in the formula sheet)\n### representations, graphs, and equations of motion\n#### position time graphs\n- basically y-value is position, and x-value is time.\n- the gradient of the position-time graph is velocity.\n\t- therefore, if the graph is like linear, then velocity is constant.\n\t- furthermore, if the graph is quadratic-like, then velocity is changing.\n\t\t- to calculate the non-uniform velocity, the gradient will be the tangent to the point of interest![](notes/images/Screen%20Shot%202023-03-22%20at%206.22.09%20pm.png) (photo attached cos idk how to explain it in words!!)\n#### velocity time graphs\n- shows how velocity of an object changes over time.\n- area of a velocity graph is the displacement.\n- gradient of a velocity time graph is the acceleration\n- to calculate average acceleration, use $a=\\frac{v-u}{t}$\n- if gradient is curved and non-uniform (like position time), then acceleration non-linear. if it is uniform and linear, then acceleration is constant.\n#### acceleration time graphs \n![](notes/images/Screen%20Shot%202023-03-22%20at%206.24.45%20pm.png)\nillustrate the jumps with dotted lines i think is what is recommended\n#### uniform acceleration\n- when no grah what to do?\n- simple: use more precise and faster methods involving constant or uniform acceleration\n- use $a=\\frac{\\delta v}{t}=\\frac{v-u}{t}$\n\t- this can be rearranged to get $v=u+at$\n- average velocity is $v_{avg}=\\frac{s}{t}$\n- since v average is half of the final - initial velocities $v_{avg}=\\frac{1}{2}(v+u)$\n\t- $\\frac{s}{t}=\\frac{1}{2}(v+u)$\n\t- $s=\\frac{1}{2}(v+u)t$ (whoa an equation of motion, derived from simple formulas)\n- we know displacement is the area of a velocity time graph, which can be represented as $s=ut+\\frac{1}{2}(v-u)\\times t$\n\t- we also know that $a=\\frac{{v-u}}{t}$\n\t- such $s=ut+\\frac{1}{2}\\times a\\times t\\times t=ut+\\frac{1}{2}at^2$\n### vertical motion and gravity\n- acceleration is 9.80m\n- substitute for equations of motion.\n- that's it.\n### newton's three laws of motion\n#### force preface\n force can be thought of as push or pull\n- forces that directly act upon a body are called **contact forces**, because the force is only experienced when contact is maintained. \n\t- forces acted upon the body at a distance are **non-contact** forces.\n- a force is measured in newtons\n#### 1. an object in motion stays in motion (maintain constant velocity) unless an unbalanced, external force acts upon it (the object).\n- the term **maintains a constant velocity** implies that, if the object is moving, then it will continue to move with a velocity that has the same magnitude and direction. e.g. a car moving 12m/s south after a set amount of time will still be moving at 12m/s (this is also consistent with zero velocity)\n- **unless** implies an otherwise for the non-continuation of a constant velocity, and is shown through an **unbalanced** acting force.\n- terminal velocity is the state of time when the speed a skydiver falls is equal to the air resistance, such the skydiver is unable to gain acceleration without changing anything such as mass or shape.\n- ##### inertia\n\t- the law is expanded upon with inertia.\n\t- inertia is considered to be the resistance to a change in motion of an object.\n\t- as the mass of an object increases, inertia increases.\n\t- inertia causes:\n\t\t- harder to start moving a stationery object.\n\t\t- harder to stop moving a object with a velocity.\n\t\t- harder to change the direction of motion.\n\t\t- this can be demonstrated in real life through shopping carts.\n#### 2. force = mass x acceleration\n- connects mass, acceleration and forces\n- newtons 2nd law can be edited to fit with change in momentum\n- since $a=\\frac{v-u}{\\Delta t},F=m \\frac{v-u}{\\Delta t}=\\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t}$\n#### 3. every force has an equal and opposing force.\n- when hammer hits nail, the nail and the hammer both experience forces.\n\t- the force experienced by hammer is relative to the force experienced by the nail.\n\t- this observation follows newton's third law. stating every force has an equal and opposing force.\n- in a collision of a large bus and a small car, the force both experiences are the same.\n\t- but due to the difference in mass, one has a higher acceleration, whilst the other has a lower acceleration.\n- this is true for gravity as well - called the normal force.\n\t- abbreviated as $F_{N}$ or $N$\n### free body diagram  \n### applying the relationship F=ma and Fweight=mg using free body diagrams.\n## momentum\n- p=mv where p is momentum (kgm/s), m is mass of object (kg), v is velocity of object (m/s)\n### conservation of momentum (1d collisions)\n- $\\sum p_{before}=\\sum p_{after}$\n- or expressed as $m_{1}u_{1} + m_{1}u_{2}=m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{1}$ \n\t- blah blah blah yk what each variable means.\n\t- if the objects colliding joins together then its $m_{1}u_{1}+m_{1}u_{2}=m_{3}v_{3}$\n\t- if the objects explode and break apart into two objects then it is $m_{1}u_{1}=m_{2}v_{2}+m_{3}v_{3}$\n### change in momentum // impulse\n- $i=\\Delta p=p_{final}-p_{initial}=mv-mu=m(v-u)$ (impulse is change in momentum)\n- area of force time graph = momentum change = impulse (since $F=\\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t}$)\n## energy\n### work\n- work is a measurement of how much energy to transfers forces\n- measured in joules ($\\frac{kg\\times m^2}{s^2}$), since work is = Fs = ma x s = m x m/s^2 x s\n\t- since W=Fs, 1J = 1N x 1m = 1Nm\n\t- 1J = 1N x 1m = 1kgm/s^2 x 1m = 1kgm^2/s^2\n### energy conservation\n### energy equations\n## power","lastmodified":"2023-03-24T02:01:45.388332303Z","tags":null},"/notes/AE/specialist/PIGEON-HOLE":{"title":"pigeonhole principle","content":"[go back](notes/subsections/spec.md)\n\n*based on the cambridge seniors maths chapter 1H*\n\n## Pigeonhole principle\n\u003e If n+1 or more objects are placed into n holes, then some hole contains at least two objects\n\n\u003e ### Example 31\n\u003e You have 13 red, 10 blue and 8 green socks.
