This causes to heat the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, which increases the average global temperature. Climate Change describes Long-term weather pattern, and with increased average global temperatures, wind currents are altered, extra ice melts, and as a result of the ice melting, the sea level rises. This causes the long-term weather pattern to be disrupted and become chaotic, which results in undesirable natural disasters such as higher bushfire rate and intensity, as well as a higher temperature throughout the globe.\n\n# Organic Chemistry\n\n## What is Organic Chemistry?\n\n- Organic Chemistry is the study of Hydrocarbon compounds.\n\n## Fractional Distillation\n\n- Crude oil is an exceptionally valuable resource.\n    - Properties of a Black, Viscous, Thick and oozy liquid mixture.\n    - It is a mixture of many different hydrocarbons compounds.\n        - Hydrocarbon compounds contain different chain lengths.\n            - Intermolecular forces are forces ***between*** molecules\n                - The greater the number of molecules (hence having a longer chain), the greater the intermolecular force.\n                - Hydrocarbons with shorter chains have weaker intermolecular force.\n                - Less energy is to break/pull the shorter chained hydrocarbons. Vice versa.\n                    - The process of breaking is evaporation of the chains, by turning it from liquid to gas.\n                    - Heat energy is used to break apart the hydrocarbons.\n                    - A higher temperature is required to break apart longer chained hydrocarbons.\n            - Intramolecular forces are forces ***in*** molecules\n- Fractional Distillation is a separation process based on differing boiling points of different fractions.\n    - Fraction: A group of crude oil constituents that has a similar boiling point.\n    - $\\therefore$\n- Through this, it provides Hydrocarbons, which is used to manufacture many different chemicals and even plastics.\n\n## Fractional Distillation in Steps\n\n1. In a furnace, the crude oil is heated up to a very high temperature.\n2. The hot oil, now mostly in vapour form is pumped into the **fractionating column**.\n    1. The fractionating column has a heat gradient.\n        1. Hot at the bottom, Cool at the top.\n3. Hydrocarbons rise through the **fractionating column** (as gas) making their way through bubble caps in each tray.\n4. Depending on the boiling point, hydrocarbons will get to a same level in the **fractioning column, condense**, and be collected in a **fractionating tray** outside the column.\n    1. The fractionating tray is a tray of hydrocarbons that has condensed at the same temperature\n    2. Same boiling point hydrocarbons will have the same temperature where their chains are converted from liquid to gas.\n5. Hydrocarbons with similar boiling point are collected in the same try and become one fraction.\n\nTL:DR; Crude oil is a mixture of important hydrocarbons, and fractional distillation is the method used to separate the hydrocarbons in crude oil. Hydrocarbons move up the **fractionating column**, until each fraction turns into their respective liquid.\n\n## Usage of different hydrocarbon fractions\n\n- Petrol\n    - Fuel for cars.\n- Naptha\n    - Essential ingredient for plastic, and other plastics.\n- Kerosine\n    - Aircraft fuel.\n- Diesel\n    - Cars or vans.\n- Bitumen\n    - A mixture of large chained hydrocarbons used to lay road.\n- Butane\n    - The gas that comes out of gas taps in the school classrooms.\n\n## Alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, cycloalkanes, cycloalkenes\n\n+functional groups and generale formula :)\n\n\u003caside\u003e\nüóíÔ∏è Naming doesn‚Äôt yet account for isomers (covered in another section)\n\n\u003c/aside\u003e\n\n### Alkyl\n\nMethyl $CH_3$\n\nEthyl $C_2H_3$\n\nPropyl $C_3H_7$\n\n- Question: Compare saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons\n- Answer: Each carbon atom bonds with the maximum number of hydrogen atoms in a saturated Hydrocarbon.\n    - Compared to, an unsaturated hydrocarbon, where less than the maximum amount of hydrogen is bonded to carbons.\n        \n        Saturated hydrocarbons are relatively unreactive.

Elements are composed of extremely small, indivisible particles called atoms.\n\t2. All Atoms of given element are identical having same size, mass and chemical properties. Atoms of different elements have different size, mass and chemical properties.\n\t3. Atoms are not created or destroyed during chemical reaction.\n\t4. A chemical reaction involves only separation, combination. Or rearrangement of atoms.\n\t5. Compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine in a specific ratio.\n- Many of the atomic theory is wrong and disproven by modern atomic theory (1, 2, 5), but his original proposition granted a new perspective on atoms.\n- ### three laws (DO WE EVEN NEED TO KNOW THIS)\n\t- #### The law of definite proportions:\n\t\t- mr dalton proposed \"compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine in a specific ratio\" \n\t\t- this is true given our modern understanding of chemistry.\n\t\t- e.g. calcium oxide will only occur with ca and o in fixed ratios\n\t- #### The law of conservation of mass\n\t\t- mr dalton proposed \"atoms are not created nor destroyed or changed into different types; a chemical reaction involves separation, combination or rearrangement of atoms.\" thus there must be the same amount of atoms in the reactants of a chemical reaction as the atoms in the product.\n\t- #### The law of multiple proportions\n\t\t- mr dalton proposed \"whenever two elements form more than one compound, the different masses of one element that combines with a fixed mass of the \" WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG THIS IS LIMITED AND DISPROVEN THROUGH POLYMERS (?) AND OLIGOMERS (?)\n- ## disadvantages of his theory:\n\t1. Atoms are divisible, they are made of smaller particles known as subatomic particles.\n\t2. Not all atoms for a given element are identical: some elements have atoms that differ in terms of \u003cu\u003emass\u003c/u\u003e and \u003cu\u003edensity\u003c/u\u003e (different number of neutrons). These are called isotopes.\n\t3. Elements are not in fact different in all aspects, eg argon calcium both have AMU of 40 (isobars)\n\t4. dalton claims elements combine in whole number ratio, which isn't true in complex compounds\n\t5. allotropes contradict the statement elements of the same kind have same properties. e.g. charcoal, graphite, diamond.\n\t6. no suggestion to the structure of the atom\n# JJ Thomson 1897-1904\n- Discovered the electron.\n- cathode ray experiment\n\t- in a sealed (evaporated) glass tube, metal terminals are placed at each end, acting as electrodes.\n\t- invisible rays called cathode rays are produced from a cathode (negative terminal) towards the anode, which causes certain materials (called phosphors, such as neon) to glow.\n\t- Thomson observed and concluded that cathode rays was a stream of negatively charged particles with mass, which became known as electrons.\n\t\t- Passed through electric and magnetic fields:\n\t\t\t- cathode rays passed straight through\n\t\t\t\t- thus cathode rays are affected by electric and magnetic fields.\n\t\t\t- the field deviates towards the positive plate. \n\t\t\t\t- thus the ray is negatively charged\n\t\t\t- diagram: ![](content/notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020230301090847.png)\n- He determined the mass of the particle to be ~1/2000 AMU since the magnitude of the fields is known.\n- he realised that\n\t- atoms contain negatively charged particles.\n\t\t- he repeated the experiment with multiple types of materials in the cathode, but the beam is produced every time.\n\t- since all atoms are neutral:\n\t- atoms also must contain a positively charged particles.\n- ## plum pudding model\n\t- he knew atoms were neutral and contained negative charge.\n\t\t- therefore they must contain equal positive charge.\n\t- thomson suggested atom is comprised of electrons and protons spread with uniform mass and charge.\n\t- weaknesses\n\t\t- electrons is now known to be occupying fixed orbitals\n\t\t- under the model, alpha particles would not be deflected against an element, and passes right through, which does not align with the results found in the gold leaf experiment.\n\n# Ernest Rutherford 1911\n- alpha particles shoot at gold leaf (a thin sheet of gold a few atoms wide)\n- sheet is surrounded by zinc sulfide\n\t- alpha particles collide with zinc sulfide to make flashes of light and microscope is used to observe the impact position.\n- observations:\n\t1. most alpha particles pass through gold foil\n\t\t- this means that most of an element is empty space\n\t2. some alpha particles were deflected (in a minor way)\n\t\t- the discovery of a neutral, the nucleus region in the atom.\n\t\t- there must exist a positively charged region called a proton.\n\t\t- this also means that the positively charged region is a small part of the atom.\n\t3. some alpha particles were deflected (significantly)\n\t\t- reconfirms that protons must be concentrated at the centre of the atom (nucleus)\n\t- expectations of the atom was that\n\t\t- the alpha particles pass through the atom or none passes through, but instead some were deflected.\n- ### rutherfords model\n\t- atom comprises of mostly empty space. the space is occupied by electrons.\n\t- electron orbits a small central region (0.05%)\n# Niels Bohr 1913\n- Orbitals of electrons, and the line emission spectra.\n- Scientists found that when an electric discharge is passed throguh a discharge tube containing hydrogen gas at low pressure, it emits light.\n- The light when passed through a prism split sup into a set of 5 lines. This spectrum is called the line spectrum of hydrogen. This is known as the \u003cu\u003eline emission spectrum\u003c/u\u003e. Scientists were unable to explain this.\n- ## bohr's model\n- bohr's model stated the following: (the three postulates)\n\t- **fixed orbital**: electrons move in a circular orbit around the nucleus under influence of electrostatic attraction of the nucleus.\n\t- **angular momentum is quantised**\n\t\t- electrons occupy fixed energy levels\n\t\t- these fixed energy levels do not emit radiation, as these orbits are stable (see [Maxwell's Law](notes/AE/chemistry/MAXWELLS-LAW.md))\n\t- **energy transitions**: electrons can transition to higher or lower energy levels by emitting or absorbing fixed quantities of energy (photons)\n\t\t- an electron can transition to a higher state by absorbing a photo with energy equal to the exact difference in energies between 2 electron orbits (final and initial)\n\t\t- an electron can transition to a lower state by emitting a photo with energy equal to the exact difference in energies between 2 electron orbits (final and initial)\n- ### emission spectra\n\t- when an electric discharge is passed through a discharge tube, electrons that are found in the discharge transfer some kinetic energy during collision to the atoms' electrons.\n\t- the electron issued the atom is then excited to a higher energy state, and the incident electron will decelerate and be deflected in another direction (?)\n\t- electrons become unstable in higher energy state, and will transition down to the ground state. \n\t\t- this releases energy in the form of radiation, the energy is equal to E2-E1.\n\t- frequency of the radiation (therefore colour) is proportional to the energy it has, one specific wavelength/frequency of light will be produced per transition.\n\t- a unique set of photons with a specific wavelength is produced (as multiple transitions can occur within an atom). when these emissions are captured and analysed in a line spectrometer, you can only see one light present.\n- unique spectra: discrete energy levels for atoms are fixed and unique/atom.\n\t- as a result the discrete energy level differences are also fixed and unique to each element.\n\t- each element has difference emission and absorption spectra as the range frequencies of light emitted are based on the discrete energy level differences.\n\t- electrons are quantised (only specific/discrete values are allowed), as in they cannot be between electron energy shells.\n\t\t- the electrons are bumped up/down by absorbing or emitting photon energy.\n- ### problems with bohrs model\n\t- multi-electron atoms\n\t\t- does not work with atoms with 1+ electrons in the valence shell, as it's not possible to calculate all the spectral lines of all other atoms, as this model has classical components (electrostatic attraction)\n\t- relative intensities of spectral lines\n\t\t- the spectral lines are not of equal density\n\t\t- bohrs model doesn't explain why some electron transition would be favoured, and wavelength of light appears more intense in the spectra.\n\t- hyperfine lines\n\t\t- 2 bands contained in a single band\n\t- zeeman effect\n\t\t- when a gas is excited in a magnetic field, emission spectrum shows a splitting of the spectral lines.\n\n# James Chadwick 1932\n- discovered the neutron\n- determined protons made only 1/2 the mass of the atom when he analysed Rutherford's experimental data; specifically the extent and frequency of alpha particle defllection.\n- Thus he believed there was a hidden component of the atom that constituted its remaining mass (50%)\n- ## Experiment\n- in 1932, he discovered that beryllium when bombarded with alpha particles emitted a very energetic stream of radiation, originally thought to be gamma.\n- the properties did not align with gamma rays. it was penetrating alike gamma rays, and it was not deflected upon passing through a magnetic field, therefore it was neutral.\n- radiation when collided with paraffin\n\n# Development of atomic structure\n\nAtomic theory, ancient greeks thought everything was made of a solid matter which cannot be broken down even more\n\nJohn dalton proposed atoms as solid spheres, and there exists different types of spheres for different elements.\n\nJJ Thompson plum pudding model - showed that there exists electrons (negatively charged particles) inside the atom\n\nErnest Rutherford nuclear model, discovered the nucleus, and assumed negative charge surrounds it through the gold leaf experiment, some alpha particles were deflected. Flaw was electron rush into nucleus causing it to collapse\n\nNiels Bohr proposed electron orbit and energy levels of electrons.\n\nGround state blah blah blah\n\n# tl:dr\nlazy fuck\n1. john dalton 1803\n\t1. atomic theory of matter\n\t2. said a lot of wrong shit, but was fundamental to modern atomic theory\n\t3. said\n\t\t1. everything is made up of undivisible particles called atoms\n\t\t2. atoms of different elements have different physical/chemical properties\n\t\t3. atoms of the same elements has the same physical/chemical properties e.g. size n stuff\n\t\t4. atoms cannot be created or destroyed\n\t\t\t1. therefore in a equation the reactants must equal the products\n\t\t5.

Sample of the element/compound is introduced to a colourless, non-luminous flame.\n\t- In the experiment, we used ethanol, which was a coloured flame rather than a colourless one. This reduced the accuracy of the experiment and is therefore a systematic error.\n2. As substance is heated, electrons become excited, as they gain energy the electrons can transition into a higher energy state.\n3. Because the electrons are in a higher energy state, they are unstable. So they quickly transition back to their ground state, which emits photons with specific wavelengths (equal to the diff in energy levels)\n4. Therefore, the photons have specific wavelengths, and the specific wavelengths mean specific colours are observed.\n5. Since excited electrons can transition to their ground state in multiple stages, a set of diff photons of diff wavelengths can be emitted.\n\t- This means a spectra of different wavelengths of light is noticed.\n6. This test is only valid for some metals, as most non-metals emit frequencies outside of visible spectrum, and cannot be identified.\n## What can the test be used for\n- Ionic salts: simple ionic solids and metals can be used.\n- Because when heated, the metal ions and anions separate, producing emission within visible spectrum.\n## weaknesses of flame test\n-  the test cannot detect low concentrations of most¬†[ions](notes/AE/chemistry/DEFINITIONS.md).\n- salt metal may not be excited by relatively low temperature of the ethanoal flame (magnesium)\n- salt may not be completely excited (diff colour being observed)\n- does not work with most non metals\n- ethanol and oxygen may get involved, changing the observed colour.\n- The brightness of the signal varies from one sample to another. For example, the yellow emission from sodium is much brighter than the red emission from the same amount of¬†lithium.\n- Impurities or contaminants affect the test results.¬†[Sodium](https://www.thoughtco.com/sodium-element-facts-606471), in particular, is present in most compounds and will colour the flame. Sometimes a blue glass is used to filter out the yellow of sodium.\n- The test cannot differentiate between all elements. Several metals produce the same flame colour. Some compounds do not change the colour of the flame at all.\n\nrelated: \n- [atomic structures](notes/AE/chemistry/ATOMIC-STRUCTURES.md)\n- [emission spectra](notes/AE/chemistry/EMISSION-SPECTRA.md)","lastmodified":"2023-03-05T02:45:33.060767847Z","tags":null},"/notes/AE/chemistry/INQ-SKILLS":{"title":"Science Inquiry Skills Definitions","content":"\n- Hypothesis: link between independent and dependent variable, and a prediction on what is going to happen (observation).\n- Independent variable: the variable that is changed, it is the one being investigated.
