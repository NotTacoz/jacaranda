## SIS
- Investigating two reactions $$CaCO_{3} (s) + 2HCl (aq) \to CaCl_{aq} (s) + H_{2}O(l)+CO_{2} (g)$$
### Hazard
- potential events that causes harm
- HCl is corrosive
### Risk
- how likely of the occurrence of event that causes harm
### Minimise Risk
- ??

## another 1
- Investigating two reactions $$Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3}(aq)+2HCl(aq)\to_{2}NaCl(aq)+SO_{2}(g)+S(s)+H_{2}O(l)$$
### Hazard
- 1.0 molL-1 HCl (aq) corrosive
- sulphur dioxide (g) is toxic
### Risk
- contact with skin, you have burns, contact with eyes you have irritation.
- sulphur dioxide causes irritation to respiratory system when inhaled
### Minimise Risk
- wear closed shoes
- use fume hood/respirator
- carry the experiment out in well ventilated area.

## another 1
- Investigating two reactions $$Cu(s)+4HNO_{3}\to Cu(NO_{3})2+2H_{2}O+2NO_{2}$$
### Hazard
- $NO_{2}$ is toxic, nauseous gas.
- $HNO_{3}$ is corrosive
### Risk
- causes irritation to respiratory system when inhaled.
- contact with skin cause burns and causes irritation with eyes.
### Minimise Risk
- use fume cupboard/hood
