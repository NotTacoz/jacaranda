- C6H12 is liquid - remember liquid and solutions and gases of hydrocarbon.
- C2H6 is gas, Cl2 is gas - remember liquid and solutions and gases of hydrocarbons.
- No visible reaction of substitution if there is no catalyst.
	- write No reaction for equation, and for observation describe reactants forming no reaction
- C6H6+Br2 -> C6H5Br + HBr
- sodium chloride is a salt and not corrosive
- write if hypothesis is proven/not and then provide EVIDENCE, it is a TWO mark question, so give a response of TWO MARKS.
- maxwell boltzman curve, when there is no kinetic energy, number of particles are not at 0.
