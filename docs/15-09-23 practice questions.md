- explain, using relevant diagrams, why NaCl readily dissolves in water but does not dissolve in cyclohexane
	- sodium chloride is ionic compound
	- $NaCl(aq)\to Na^+(aq)+Cl^-(aq)$
	- draw water is polar, and ion-dipole interaction between NaCl and H2O
	- cyclohexane is non-polar, and therefore cannot form forces of attraction between ions that can overcome strong ionic bonds, only forms dispersion forces.
- explain, using relevant diagrams, why ethanol readily dissolves in water but
	- hydrogen bonding between ethanol and water is able to overcome teh sum of intermolecular forces.
