## which geometric isomer has higher dispersion forces?
- branched isomers have a smaller surface area
- -> they are more compact
- -> there is less area of contact between temporary/induced dipoles, and/or molecules
- -> dispersion force strength decreases
- -> boiling point decreases
- functional groups also increase the boiling point (eg dichloroethane has higher boiling boiling point than ethane)

cis and trans has same physical properties pretty much
