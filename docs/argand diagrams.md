## argand diagrams
- [[notes/complex numbers|complex numbers]] don't fit on the real line, but they can be represented using a second axis called the [[notes/argand diagrams|argand diagram]]
- ![[notes/images/Pasted image 20230912095941.png|imaginary axis perpendicular to the "real" axis|300]]
- here is the imaginary axis perpendicular to the "real" axis
- so the number 3+2i is on the plane somewhere!
- every point in the plane is a complex number - and (conversely) any complex number is a point in the plane!
- called the complex plane but traditionally called an [[notes/argand diagrams|argand diagram]]
- all real numbers ==are a subset of the complex plane! as a real number== e.g. 3 is a complex number, which is 3 + 0i, so any real number can be thought of as special kinds of complex numbers!
- leads to some interesting mathematics (amazing and spectacular) which is going to get taught later on by dr pearce !! 
### vectors
- complex numbers can be alternatively be viewed as 2d vectors, each point has a position vector which determines its positions
- can be visualised the way you add and subtract [[notes/archive/AEold/specialist/lessonnotes/T1W6L2|vectors]].

## rotation about the origin
- when the complex number $2+3i$ is multiplied by $-1$, the result is -2 - 3i. this is achieved through a rotation of 180deg about the origin.
- when complex number 2+3i is multiplied by i, we obtain
	- i(2+3i) = 2i+3i^2
	- = 2i-3
	- = -3 + 2i
- results in a rotation of 90deg anticlockwise
- explored further in year 12 course

## reflection in the horizontal axis
- the conjugate of a complex number z = a + bi is z = a - bi (?)
