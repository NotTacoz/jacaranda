## electrical circuits topic test
- electric field lines (3)
	- freest 3 marks of all time :/
- units of constant (1)
	- this is such an easy question?????????????????? how get wrong what doing
- calculation error, missed pm when sqrt (1)
	- what doing
- lack of explanation and why - didn't answer the question fully (1)
- calculation error (1)
	- calculator... ???? how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how how hwo how how how howh woh whow howh whow howh wohw how how how how how HOW HOW
- didnt read question (1)
	- hOW
	- Might As well Stab my Eyes out.
- gold leaf electroscope
	- didnt explain how gold foil stands away (1)
		- how
			- electrons were remove from electroscope resulting in net positive charge. since the foil and pole will both have the same charge, they repel each other, and the foil stands away from the pole.
	- didnt explain how the charged rods and metal plate become opposing (1)
		- Ok
			- electrons will be repelled (by induction) from the metal pole and decrease the magnitude of the positive charge on the pole & foil. Therefore, the foil will move closer to the pole.
if 2 or more marks, write working out :grin:
this could have been 92% if no stupid mistakes........................
## internal resistance validation
- internal resistance definition (2)
	- refers to the resistance due to the cell itself.
	- acts as a source of resistance connected in series with the circuit.
- set up for experiment (1)
	- variable resistor needs an arrow :(
	- missing a switch
- two factors that can lead to an increase in internal resistance in a battery (4)
	- tmeperature
	- ion mobility
	- electrolyte conductivity
	- change in structure, porosity & composition of electrodes
	- etc.............................
- uncertainty calculations (2)
	- PLEASE
