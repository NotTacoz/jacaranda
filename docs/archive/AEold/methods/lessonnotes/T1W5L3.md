# quadratic equations

- many situations can be modelled using quadratic equation, so it is useful to be able to solve them.
  1.  rearrange the equation into the form $ax^2 + bx + c =0$
      1. you may need to expand and simplify first.
  2.  factorise the quadratic, using the techniques.
  3.  use null factor theorem (if ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0) to solve for x

practice:
solve $2x^2 + 5x - 12 = 0$

- factors of $2 \times -12$ which make $5$ is $-3$ and $-8$
- $\frac{(2x-3)(2x+8)}{2}=0$
- $\frac{(2x-3)(x+4)\times2}{2}=0$
- $(2x-3)(x+4)=0$
  OR
- $2x^2 - 3x + 8x-12=0$
- $x(2x-3)+4(2x-3)=0$
- $2x-3=0$ or $x+4=0$
- $x=\frac{3}{2},-4$

# quadratics in turning point form

- quadratics in turning point form $y = a(x-h)^2+k$ can be visualised as transformations of $y=x^2$
- [https://www.geogebra.org/m/EFbtkvVP](https://www.geogebra.org/m/EFbtkvVP)
- when a is positive:
  - parabola is **concave up**
  - the turning point is a **minimum**
- when a is negative, the parabola reflects about the x-axis
  - the parabola is **concave down**
  - the turning point is a **maximum**
- the parabola dilates from the x-axis by a factor of a
  - when $|a|\gt1$, the parabola is 'stretched' **vertically**.
  - when $|a|\lt1$, the parabola is squashed **vertically**.
  - the dilations are NOT horizontal !!
- $y=ax^2$ to $y=a(x-h)^2+k$
- the parabola

  - translates right $h$ units
    - left if $h$ is negative
  - translates up $k$ units
    - down if $k$ is negative
  - the turning point is at ($h$,$k$)
  - the axis of symmetry is at $x=h$

- for the equation $y=-(x+1)^2+4$
- a. axis of symmetry
  - x = -1
- b. turning point and nature
  - (-1, 4) MAX
- c. y intercept
  - $y=-(0+1)^2+4$
  - $=-1+4=3$
  - (0, 3)
- d. x intercept
  - $0=-(x+1)^2+4$
  - $4=(x+1)^2$
  - $\pm2=x+1$
  - $x+1=2$ or $x+1=-2$
  - $x = 3$ or $x = -1$
  - $(1,0)$ or $(-3,0)$
