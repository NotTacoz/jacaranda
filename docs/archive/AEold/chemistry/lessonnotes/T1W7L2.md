## different types of bonding

- how to link electronic configuration of elements on the periodic table bonding.
- yesterday talked about metallic bonding.
- alloy is mixture not compound.
  - bronze or brass, which is a mixture of different metals.

## ionic bonding

> [!note] electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions in network.

- metal (not entirely true, for year 11 foundation chemistry it is fine) & non-metal.
- examples:
  - NaCl
  - MgO
  - CaCO3 (metal cation + non-metals anion)
  - etc etc etc etc
- to achieve stability of nearest noble gas, for example sodium, will lose an electron
  - sodium chloride
    - $Na (2, 8, 1) \to Na^+(2,8)+\overline{e}$
    - $Cl(2,8,7)+\overline{e}\to Cl^-(2,8,8)$
    - as a result you get sodium chloride compound ($NaCl$) in 1:1 compound.
      - important to show ratio because it is a molecule and not a network.
  - magnesium chloride
    - $Mg(2,8,2)\to Mg^{2_+}(2,8)+2\overline{e}$
    - $Cl(2,8,7)+\overline{e}\to Cl^-(2,8,8)$
    - $Cl(2,8,7)+\overline{e}\to Cl^-(2,8,8)$
    - $MgCl_2$, 1:2
- lattice structure

- sodium ions are in **lattice**, ions are **not free to move**, and cannot conduct charge, even though they are charged particles. **the ions are not mobile.**
  - therefore, sodium chloride does not conduct electricity.
  - however, sodium chloride solution does conduct electricity, because sodium chloride is disassociated into charged chloride and charged sodium.
    - cathode and anion in beaker, cation go to cathode, chloride goes to anode.
  - if ionic compound is soluble, then it is good electrolyte.
    - the more soluble, the better electrolyte it is.

### physical properties

- strong **electrostatic forces of attraction** (strong bonds).
- a network of ionic bonds (lattice), so a lot of bonds to break to separate.
  - requires a lot of **heat energy**.
    - usually has a **high melting and boiling point**
- **electrical conductivity**
  - not when solid, but when dissolved (**always** if they are soluble).
  - are **often** soluble in water
- brittle
  - ions can be displaced, and ions with the same charge could be located close to each other, which causes them to repel, and lead the structure to **shatter**.

## lewis diagram

hey lois

- dot and cross diagram = lewis diagram!
  ![500](notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020230314123757.png)
- lewis diagram
  - dot-dot
  - dot-cross
    - show diagram of atom, and show what happens to it.
    - show outer shell
    - dot x dot, for dot x cross just use X instead of filled in dot :p
