- Hypothesis: link between independent and dependent variable, and a prediction on what is going to happen (observation).
- Independent variable: the variable that is changed, it is the one being investigated. (Use units when possible)
- Dependent variable: the variable that is measured (Use units when possible)
- Control variables: Factors that are kept the same to make it a fair test
  - Preliminary work: used to identify what factors can be controlled, how to set experiment up, how to minimise uncontrollable variables.
    - Determines the accuracy of the experiment.
- Validity vs Reliability
  - Validity: how well does it answer the question posed? is the experiment 'fair': all variables are the same except the one we are testing.
    - the validity of the experiment is determined by systematic error.
  - reliability: how consistent is the data
- repetition: increases consistency thus increases reliability.
- replication: others, using the same experiment, doing the same investigation.
- precision: the degree of detail the equipment allows.
- risk assessment: to reduce chances of inquiry, consider:
  - anonymity
  - confidentiality
  - voluntary participation
    - can withdraw at any time
  - informed consent
